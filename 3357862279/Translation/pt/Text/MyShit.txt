Zheng 兄弟！我突然想起来之前还漏了点消息没有告诉你！\n阴冥海的灵魂体在正常情况下，修士是无法看见或感知到的。所以Zheng 兄弟在去往阴冥海前必须以秘法修炼成阴阳瞳神通。\n这神通只需前往吞云海收集七彩月兰三株，腐骨灵花三株，而后前往阴冥泉将草药投入水中，以泉水擦拭双目即可。=Irmão Zheng! Lembrei de algo que esqueci de te contar! O corpo espiritual do Mar Submundo não pode ser visto nem percebido normalmente por cultivadores. Portanto, antes de ir ao Mar Submundo, irmão Zheng deve cultivar a habilidade secreta Olho Yin Yang. Essa técnica exige apenas coletar três Orquídeas Lunares Coloridas e três Flores Espirituais Ossificadas no Mar das Nuvens Engolidas, depois mergulhar as ervas na Água do Olho Yin e limpar os olhos com a água da fonte.

桀桀桀桀，不要开玩笑了。作为一个魂修，我能感应到姑娘你身上根本没有带着魂魄。=Hehe, não brinque. Como cultivador de almas, sinto que você não carrega nenhuma alma, moça.

桀桀桀桀，学会了吗？=Hehe, aprendeu?
桀桀桀桀，学会了。=Hehe, aprendi.
这炼魂秘术乃我禾山道的立派之本，目标修士修为越高，魂魄的质量越高，能炼制的魂珠也就越多。=Esta técnica secreta de refino de alma é o fundamento do Caminho Heshan. Quanto maior o nível do cultivador-alvo, maior a qualidade da alma e mais contas de alma podem ser refinadas.

你时常在外走动，这=Você anda muito por aí, o que
一行就劳烦你了。=Eu ficarei responsável por essa tarefa.
但连他们宗门所在都不知道，=Mas nem sabemos onde fica a seita deles,
但连他们宗门所在都不知道，师弟你时常在外走动，这天星城一行就劳烦你了。=Mas nem sabemos onde fica a seita deles, discípulo júnior, você anda muito por aí, então eu ficarei responsável por essa missão na Cidade Tianxing.

咳咳…信号有点不好。我在这把剑里，牵引灵机，能些许感受到此方天地中修士的数量。这些信息或许会对你修行有所帮助。=Ahem... o sinal está um pouco fraco. Estou nesta espada, conduzindo a energia espiritual, e posso sentir levemente o número de cultivadores neste lado do mundo. Essas informações podem ajudar na sua prática.
是否要服用易容丹=Deseja tomar a Pílula de Transfiguração
要承受住跨州传送的空间乱流，需要化神境界，或者宁州或海域声望达到誉满天下，由大势力出手协助跨州传送=Para suportar a turbulência espacial do teletransporte interestadual, é necessário estar no Reino da Transformação Divina, ou ter reputação máxima em Ningzhou ou no mar, com auxílio das grandes potências.
宁州各大主城将对你发起悬赏。你将无法使用主城传送阵，但能使用荒山传送阵。=As principais cidades de Ningzhou lançarão uma recompensa contra você. Você não poderá usar os teletransportes das cidades principais, mas poderá usar os teletransportes das Montanhas Desoladas.
允许前往宁州各大门派拜山。允许使用各大门派传送阵。=Permissão para visitar as principais seitas de Ningzhou. Permissão para usar os teletransportes das seitas.
可以请教宁州各大势力的不传绝学。可在宁州和海域之间跨州传送。=Pode aprender as técnicas secretas das grandes potências de Ningzhou. Pode teletransportar entre Ningzhou e o mar.
可以请教无尽之海各大势力的不传绝学。可在宁州和海域之间跨州传送.=Pode aprender as técnicas secretas das grandes potências do Mar Infinito. Pode teletransportar entre Ningzhou e o mar.

你用神识探向魏无极所关注的位置，但是一无所获。=Você sondou com seu sentido divino o local que Wei Wuji estava focando, mas não encontrou nada.
哪有什么东西，老头你要是无聊就回剑里呆着去，别打断我。=Não há nada, velho, se estiver entediado, volte para a espada e não me interrompa.
魏无极没有理会你的不满，反倒是尝试驱动你背上的铁剑，似乎打算自己去把夹缝里的东西抠出来。=Wei Wuji ignora sua insatisfação e tenta controlar a espada de ferro nas suas costas, parecendo querer extrair ele mesmo algo da fenda.
魏无极的灵体在藏经阁中显现还好说，如不是有人亲眼目睹也不会造成麻烦，但若是放任他在这驱动铁剑，鬼知道产生的波动会引来谁。=O corpo espiritual de Wei Wuji aparecer no Pavilhão de Escrituras não causaria problemas se não fosse visto, mas se ele usar a espada aqui, quem sabe quem será atraído pelas perturbações.
即便是解释为想验证一下刚从玉简中看到的秘术思路，今天也难以脱身。=Mesmo explicando que queria verificar a técnica secreta vista na jade, será difícil escapar hoje.
你一手按住背上的铁剑，忙不迭地就走到魏无极身边。=Você pressiona a espada de ferro nas suas costas com uma mão e corre até Wei Wuji.
这是...一块玉简？=Isto é... um tablet de jade?
似乎和其他的不同，能屏蔽我的神识感知...老头，你知道这是什么吗？=Parece diferente dos outros, consegue bloquear minha percepção divina... Velho, você sabe o que é?
没见过，所以老夫才对它感兴趣。=Nunca vi, por isso me interesso por ele.
唔，拿走这东西应该不会被发现，我先收着吧。等回洞府再好好研究。=Hmm, levar isto não deve ser notado, vou guardar por enquanto. Estudarei melhor no meu retiro.
这东西居然能屏蔽神识探查，若不是被到处乱看的老头留意到，只怕还得在秘阁中待上不知多久。=Este item consegue bloquear a sondagem divina, se não fosse pelo velho atento, teria que ficar no gabinete secreto por tempo indeterminado.
也不知道是哪位=Não sei quem
留下的，又在秘阁中存放了多久。=Deixou para trás, e quanto tempo esteve armazenado no gabinete secreto.
也不知道是哪位前辈留下的，又在秘阁中存放了多久。=Não sei qual antecessor deixou, e quanto tempo esteve armazenado no gabinete secreto.
你再次尝试用神识读取玉简中的记录，果然没有收获。=Você tenta ler os registros no tablet de jade com seu sentido divino novamente, sem sucesso.
这玉简起初并没有什么反应。当你注入足够的水灵气后，终于是释放出淡淡的光芒。=Este tablet de jade não reagiu no começo. Quando você injetou aura de água suficiente, finalmente liberou um leve brilho.
在你试探多次后发现，似乎只要注入的水灵气足够，就可以接触它屏蔽神识的能力，进而读取其中隐藏的内容。=Após várias tentativas, percebeu que se injetar aura de água suficiente, consegue acessar sua habilidade de bloquear percepção divina e ler o que está escondido.
唔，只有一个符号...但这玉简在引领我前往某个地方...好像是门派后山。=Hmm, há apenas um símbolo... Mas este tablet de jade está me guiando a algum lugar... Parece ser os fundos da seita.
<color\=#FF0000>星河洞府</color>任务已开启=<color\=#FF0000>Retiro Xinghe</color> iniciado
<color\=#FF0000> 星河洞府 </color> 进度已更新=<color\=#FF0000> Retiro Xinghe </color> progresso atualizado
附近的人=Pessoas próximas
在玉简的指引下，你来到一个阵法前。=Guiado pelo jade, você chega a uma formação.
阵法所隐藏的空间在玉简的呼应下不断涌起涟漪作为回应，却没有开门迎客的意思。=O espaço escondido pela formação continuou a surgir com ondulações em resposta ao jade, mas não havia intenção de abrir a porta para receber convidados.
你尝试了许多办法，包括直接攻击阵法，但未能如愿以偿。=Você tentou muitas maneiras, incluindo atacar a formação diretamente, mas não conseguiu o que queria.
进不去么...至少还有些线索，去问问门中长老和=Não consegue entrar... Pelo menos há algumas pistas. Vá perguntar aos anciãos e
是否知道那个符号代表的信息吧。=Se sabem o que o símbolo representa, certo.

大殿。=Grande Salão.
掌门正好在和门中修士交代着什么。\n似乎是察觉到你有事找她，她向你点了点头，示意你稍等一会。=A Mestre da Seita estava explicando algo aos cultivadores da seita. Parecia perceber que você tinha algo a falar, e acenou para você, sinalizando que aguardasse um momento.
不多时，=Em poucos momentos,
便结束了和那位修士的对话，这才和你打招呼。=terminou a conversa com o discípulo e então cumprimentou você.
不多时，掌门便结束了和那位修士的对话，这才和你打招呼。=Em poucos momentos, a Mestre da Seita terminou a conversa com o discípulo e então cumprimentou você.
Mao 长老，不知有何要事？=Ancião Mao, qual é o assunto?
要事倒谈不上，只是有几个小问题想请=Não é nada de importante, apenas algumas perguntas que gostaria de
解惑。=Esclarecer.
要事倒谈不上，只是有几个小问题想请掌门解惑。=Não é nada de importante, apenas algumas perguntas que gostaria que a Mestre da Seita esclarecesse.
请问是否见过这个符号？=Posso perguntar se você já viu este símbolo?
这个...的确见过，我没记错的话，它应该在记载否极泰来的玉简中出现过。=Este... de fato já vi, se não me engano, ele apareceu no jade que registra o “Veto”.
可知这否极泰来是由哪位=Sabe qual deles é responsável por este “Veto”?
所创？=Criado?
掌门可知这否极泰来是由哪位前辈所创？=Mestre da Seita, sabe qual antecessor criou este “Veto”?
嗯...据秘典中记载，这神通是开派祖师星河剑仙所创。=Hmm... Segundo o segredo registrado, esta habilidade divina foi criada pelo fundador, o Imortal Espada do Rio Estelar.
关于祖师还有什么记载么？=Há mais registros sobre o fundador?
这本是门中秘辛，但Mao =Este é um segredo da seita, mas Mao
作为门中长老，告诉你也无妨。=Como ancião da seita, não há problema em contar a você.
这本是门中秘辛，但Mao 师姐作为门中长老，告诉你也无妨。=Este é um segredo da seita, mas a irmã Mao, como anciã da seita, não há problema em contar a você.
祖师留下的除门中数种天阶神通功法外，还有宗门广场上的小剑阵。=O que o fundador deixou, além de algumas técnicas divinas de nível celestial na seita, inclui também a pequena formação de espadas na praça da seita.
那剑阵的名号已经佚失，但据传门中的星河剑阵以及护宗大阵皆是后来者观摩小剑阵，然后有感而推演得来。=O nome da formação de espadas foi perdido, mas diz-se que a Formação de Espadas do Rio Estelar e a Grande Formação Protetora foram derivadas de discípulos posteriores que observaram a pequena formação e a reproduziram.
但=mas
万年前的大战后，不知是佚失了某种驱动技巧还是后来的门中弟子资质太差，再未有人能从小剑阵中悟出什么。=Após a grande batalha de milhares de anos, não se sabe se alguma técnica de ativação foi perdida ou se os discípulos posteriores eram fracos, e ninguém conseguiu compreender algo da pequena formação de espadas.
原来如此。关于祖师还有更多信息么？=Entendi. Há mais informações sobre o fundador?
秘典上能找到的就这么多，更多的不是在变动中遗失就是被销毁...连那套剑阵也...=É só isso que se encontra nos registros secretos; o resto foi perdido nas mudanças ou destruído... até mesmo aquela formação de espadas...
赐教。=Agradeço o ensinamento.
多谢掌门赐教。=Obrigado, Mestre, pelo ensinamento.
任务描述=Descrição da missão

神秘洞府=Um retiro misterioso
星河洞府=Retiro Xinghe
你在星河剑派秘阁发现了一个玉简，它似乎关系着门派的一些秘辛。=Você encontrou um jade no Pavilhão Secreto da Seita Espada do Rio Estelar, que parece estar relacionado a alguns segredos da seita.
前往=Ir para
前往风雷谷神秘洞府=Ir para o Retiro Misterioso do Vale do Vento e Trovão
前往宗门大殿=Ir para o Grande Salão da Seita
前往宗门广场=Ir para a Praça da Seita
宗门广场上，一群=Na praça da seita, um grupo de
的弟子正向大=discípulos se dirige ao grande
请教修炼事宜。=Para pedir conselhos sobre cultivo.
宗门广场上，一群炼气期的弟子正向大师姐请教修炼事宜。=Na praça da seita, um grupo de discípulos do estágio de Refino de Qi se dirige à irmã mais velha para pedir conselhos sobre cultivo.
见到你径直走了过来，似乎是以为你有什么吩咐，她们向你打完招呼后站在原地等你开口。=Ao ver você se aproximar diretamente, como se pensassem que tinha ordens, elas cumprimentam você e esperam você falar.
但你的注意力完全放在小剑阵上，只是略微点了点头便不在理会他们。=Mas sua atenção está totalmente na pequena formação de espadas, apenas acena levemente e ignora elas.
（这小剑阵似乎处于沉寂状态，光是这么看着也不知道能不能有点进展...）=(Esta pequena formação de espadas parece estar em estado de silêncio, apenas observando não se sabe se haverá progresso...)
（难道我还得去找=Será que ainda preciso ir procurar
要个权限激活剑阵么？）=Permissão para ativar a formação de espadas?)
（难道我还得去找掌门要个权限激活剑阵么？）=(Será que ainda preciso ir procurar o Mestre para pedir permissão para ativar a formação de espadas?)
（也不是不行...但解释起来挺麻烦的，不如我先给玉简注入灵力试试...=(Não é impossível... mas explicar seria complicado, melhor eu tentar injetar energia espiritual no jade primeiro...
一有了变化也就说是演练神通时激起了共鸣，蒙混一下即可。）=(Se houver alguma mudança, dizer que foi uma ressonância provocada durante o ensaio da habilidade divina, e pronto.)
（也不是不行...但解释起来挺麻烦的，不如我先给玉简注入灵力试试...万一有了变化也就说是演练神通时激起了共鸣，蒙混一下即可。）=(Não é impossível... mas explicar seria complicado, melhor eu tentar injetar energia espiritual no jade primeiro... se houver alguma mudança, dizer que foi uma ressonância provocada durante o ensaio da habilidade divina, e pronto.)
你从储物袋中拿出玉简，慢慢地向它注入水灵气。=Você pega o jade da bolsa de armazenamento e lentamente injeta aura de água nele.
随着你提供的灵气越来越多，玉简再次放出淡淡的光芒。=Conforme fornece mais aura, o jade emite novamente um brilho suave.
与之前不同，这玉简的光芒时而平静柔和，时而如怒涛翻涌，广场上的小剑阵也与之共鸣，在上空不断的舞动着。=Diferente antes, o brilho do jade ora era calmo e suave, ora agitava como ondas furiosas, e a pequena formação de espadas na praça ressoava com ele, dançando continuamente no ar.
你看着剑阵的轨迹入了神，竟短暂地进入顿悟状态。=Você observa a trajetória da formação de espadas, fica hipnotizado e entra brevemente em estado de epifania.
静则静矣，如柔水容=Quietude é quietude, como água suave.
物；动似怒涛，一泄尤千里...=The thing; moving like a furious wave, a leak of a thousand miles...
静则静矣，如柔水容万物；动似怒涛，一泄尤千里...=Stillness is stillness, like soft water.mThe thing; moving like a furious wave, a leak of a thousand miles...
静水无波凝晓雾，否极泰来星河舞...=The still water without waves condenses the dawn mist, and the stars and rivers dance...
等你回过神来，附近的弟子们虽不知道你在念叨些什么，但都一脸崇拜的看向你。=When you come back to your senses, the nearby disciples look at you with faces of adoration, even though they don't know what you're chanting.
而玉简也不知在何时耗尽了你输入的灵气，重新变成之前的样子，只是原本记录的符号竟然显现在了外壳上。=And the jade slip has also exhausted the aura you inputted at some point, reverting to its previous appearance, only that the symbols that were originally recorded are actually visible on the shell.
（果然有了变化，也不知行不行得通。）=(There's really been a change, and I don't know if it's going to work.)
在弟子们的注目礼下，你匆匆离开了广场，也未曾注意大=You left the square in a hurry, under the gaze of the disciples, and without noticing the great
当即借这个机会激励了她们一番。=Immediately, I took the opportunity to motivate them a bit.
在弟子们的注目礼下，你匆匆离开了广场，也未曾注意大师姐当即借这个机会激励了她们一番。=You left the square in a hurry, under the gaze of the disciples, and without noticing the greatsisterImmediately, I took the opportunity to motivate them a bit.
你再次来到洞府前，同之前一般缓缓向玉简中注入水灵气。=You once again come to the front of the cave and slowly inject water aura into the jade slip as before.
果然如你所料，这阵法不断荡漾，最后在你身前开启一道稳定的门户。=As you expected, the formation continued to ripple and finally opened a stable portal in front of you.
出口=exportation
剩余时间=time left
9999年=9999
一阵炫目的光芒过后，整个阵法暗淡了下来，显露出洞府的真实样貌。=After a burst of dazzling light, the entire formation dimmed, revealing the true appearance of the cave.
初入眼帘的不过是一个看不到尽头的石质甬道，其两壁刻画着一些极简的壁画，似乎是要向后来者诉说洞府主人的故事。=At first glance it was nothing more than a stone tunnel with no end in sight, and its two walls were carved with some minimalist murals that seemed to tell the story of the cave's owner to those who came after them.
你简单的用神识扫过甬道，并没有发现什么陷阱或是其他危险因素，于是小心地步入其中。=You briefly sweep through the tunnel with your divine sense, not finding any traps or other dangerous elements, and step carefully into it.
你路过第一幅壁刻时随意的扫了一眼。=You casually scan the first wall carving as you pass by.
经过漫长岁月的的冲刷后这壁刻已经有些模糊了，你只能结合壁画残余的内容以及自己的想象来推测原本的画面——描述的似乎是一位修士初入剑道时的喜悦。=After a long period of time the wall carvings have been somewhat blurred, you can only combine the remnants of the mural and your own imagination to guess the original picture - it seems to depict the joy of a cultivator when he first entered the Way of the Sword.
那位年轻修士似乎就是洞府的主人。=That young cultivator seemed to be the owner of the cave.
很有可能。=Quite possibly.
第二幅石刻依旧有些模糊，讲述的内容也十分简单——似乎是年轻修士已经剑道小成，四处挑战其他剑修。=The second stone carving was still a bit blurry and told a very simple story - it seemed that the young cultivator had already achieved a small degree of success in the Sword Dao and was going around challenging other sword cultivators.
路过好几幅在你看来有些相似的石刻后，终于有了些区别。=After passing several stone carvings that look somewhat similar to you, there is finally some difference.
虽然描绘的依旧是修士与人战斗的画面，依旧是被时间侵蚀而看不清切原貌的工笔，但这幅石刻中却有着一丝剑意含蓄欲发，待你想仔细去感受却又不知所踪。=Although the picture depicted is still a cultivator fighting with people, is still eroded by time and can not see the original cut brushwork, but this stone carving has a hint of the sword intent implicitly want to develop, to be you want to feel carefully but do not know where.
这洞府的石刻中竟还有剑意留存...=There was even sword intent remaining in the stone carvings of this cave...
哼，别忘了这很可能是星河剑派祖师留下的洞府。她作为宁州五大宗门之一的创始人，创建这洞府都不知道是多少年前的事了，虽然只是一丝剑气，但那也是对剑道领悟极其深刻的体现！=''Hmph, don't forget that this is most likely the cave mansion left behind by the Star River Sword Sect's ancestor. As the founder of one of the five great sects in Ning Zhou, she had created this cave mansion an unknown number of years ago, and even though it was only a trace of sword qi, it was a manifestation of an extremely profound comprehension of the Dao of the Sword!
不过是一缕剑气罢了。=It's just a wisp of sword energy.
我当然知道，但老头你惊讶得未免早了些，这才到石道的一半呢。=Of course I know, but old man you're surprised a little early, it's only halfway down the stone path.
你看着甬道尽头的石门，顿了顿，又补充了半句。=You look at the stone door at the end of the tunnel, pause, and add half a sentence.
后面恐怕还有更了不得的东西。=I'm afraid there's something even more impressive back there.

这道剑气也不知从何而来，仿佛是凭空出现在了你的面前，未等你分辨便已是吸收周遭灵气攻击过来。=This sword Qi also do not know where to come from, as if out of thin air in front of you, not waiting for you to distinguish is already absorbing the surrounding aura attack over.
好在它虽很是凝实，却未给你带来太多麻烦。=The good thing is that although it is very solid, it has not given you too much trouble.
老头，你怎么看？=What do you think, old man?
看什么看，有什么好看的。=What are you looking at? What's there to see.
看你一副憋笑的样子，魏无极又补上了一句。=Seeing that you look like you're holding back your laughter, Wei Wuji added another sentence.
这洞府除了外面的守护大阵肯定还有其他设置，不然光凭一幅石刻绝对无法留下这道剑气。=This cave must have other settings in addition to the outside guarding array, or else a stone carving alone would definitely not be able to leave this sword qi.
而后他便转过头去观察新的石刻，你也随之将注意力投向石壁。=And then he turns his head to observe the new carvings, and with that you turn your attention to the stone wall.
看着这幅石刻，你脑中却出现一个操练木属性剑类神通的修士身影。=While looking at this stone carving, the figure of a cultivator who maneuvered a wood-attribute sword-type aptitude appears in your mind.
一剑祭出如春华吐蕊，说是攻招却如和煦春风无半点杀气，说是守招又见其攻击绵密往复令人应接不暇。=A sword offering such as the spring Hua Spit Rui, said that the offensive moves but as warm spring breeze without half a bit of killing gas, said that the defensive moves and see its attacks are dense and repetitive people should not be able to catch up.
这修士的神通倒称得上是攻守一体，有木属性那生生不息的架势。=This cultivator's divine ability was rather described as offensive and defensive, with the wood attribute's that raw and unending frame.
只可惜剑修一向以攻击极强而著称，他这攻守一体倒有些不伦不类了。若是与老夫对上，只一剑便能破其防守令其饮恨于此，生生不息又有何用？=It's a pity that sword cultivators have always been known for their strong attacks, but his attack and defense in one is a bit unorthodox. If it is against me, just one sword can break his defense and make him hate here, what is the use of endless life?
吹得这么响亮，那老头你倒是把自己的压箱底绝活教我啊。=You're blowing so loudly. You should teach me your best skill, old man.
咳咳咳，老夫这不是记不起来了么...=Cough cough cough, I thought I couldn't remember...
魏无极一边小声嘀咕一边向前飘去。=Wei Wuji muttered in a low voice as he floated forward.
你随着魏无极的灵体向前走去。=You walk forward with Wei Wuji's spirit body.
虽说相比之前提高了戒备，但突然出现的剑气还是让你有些惊讶。=Even though you have raised your guard compared to before, the sudden appearance of the sword aura still surprises you a bit.
惊讶归惊讶，你可没有半分迟疑，手捏法诀便已是与之战作一团。=Surprised to be surprised, you can not have half a minute hesitation, hand pinch spells is already with the battle.

这魔气剑灵也就上来几招较为凌厉，不出几回合便被你击散。=This devilish sword spirit also comes up a few moves more powerful, not a fewRoundsThen you will be dispersed.
这洞府中竟还有魔气？=There's still a demonic aura in this cave?
是有些奇怪，不过能利用魔气的正道神通虽少但也不是没有，洞府主又是有大机缘之人，能在此布下一道魔气也不足为奇。=Is a little strange, but can utilize the devil's qi of the righteous divine power although less but not no, the cave master and has a great chance of people, can lay a devil's qi here is not surprising.
倒是这魔剑称得上是刚猛无匹，还有几分看头。=On the contrary, this magic sword was described as rigid and powerful, and there were a few more to see.
可惜杀心过重，一招无功则后继不足，且不合天道之理，没什么参考的价值。=Unfortunately, the killing heart is too heavy, a move without success is not enough to follow, and is not in line with the reasoning of the Heavenly Dao, there is little reference value.
你微微颔首，没有发表不同意见。=You nod slightly and make no dissenting comment.
前面应该是最后一幅石刻了，不知这次又会有什么在等着我。=Ahead of me should be the last rock carving, I wonder what awaits me this time.
不过是几道剑气而已，刚才不都被你轻松摆平了么。=It's just a few sword qi, weren't they all easily disposed of by you just now.
只是觉得留在最后的总会特殊一点罢了。=It just seems like the ones left at the end are always a little more special.
门都还没进呢，怎么就最后了？=The door's not even in yet, how come it's final?
你是不是想太多了。=You're not thinking too much.
门都还没进呢，怎么就最后了？丫头你是不是想太多了。=The door's not even in yet, how come it's final?girlYou're not thinking too much.
谁会在自己洞府的正室里放陷阱啊，肯定就到此为止了。=Who would put a trap in the main room of their cave, surely that's as far as it goes.
依老夫看，这也不算陷阱，只是出现得有些突然罢了。=In my opinion, this is not a trap, it just appeared a bit suddenly.
说完你也不再理会魏无极，独自走上前去。=After saying that you no longer pay attention to Wei Wuji and walk up alone.
不出你所料，一道剑气出现在身前。=Unsurprisingly, a sword aura appears in front of you.
这次的剑气通体金黄，不禁让你联想到与师门关系不错的，金虹剑派。=This time, the sword qi was golden in color, so you couldn't help but think of the, Golden Rainbow Sword Sect, which had a good relationship with the division.

虽不知这道剑气从何而来，但它只是将你逼退，似乎没有继续进攻的意思。=I don't know where the sword qi came from, but it just pushed you back and didn't seem to have any intention of continuing the attack.
我实力尚有不足，还是封闭了洞府以后再来吧。=I'm still not strong enough, so I'd better come back after I've closed the cave.
是否离开=whether or not to leave
老头，这次又怎么说？=Old man, what do you say this time?
 快剑重型，刚猛凌厉，重剑在势，一剑贯日。= The fast sword is heavy, fierce and stern, and the heavy sword is in potential, a sword through the sun.
这应该是金虹那位的神通。=This should be the divine ability of the Golden Rainbow One.
我看也是，难不成星河和金虹的友好关系从祖师那代就开始了？=I think so, it's hard to believe that Star River and Golden Rainbow's friendly relationship has been going on since the Ancestor's generation.
不知，印象中这俩门派的友好关系由来已久，但大都只是知道有这么个说法而已，鲜有人溯其由来。=I don't know, I was under the impression that these two sects had been friendly for a long time, but most of them just knew that there was such a thing, and few people traced the origin.
我在门中也未曾听人提起具体原因，还以为只是同为剑派方便切磋交流而已。这么看来，是有些原因的。=I have not heard anyone mention the specific reason in the door, and thought that it was just the same sword faction to facilitate the exchange of ideas. So it seems that there is some reason.
这些石刻除了第一幅是在修炼以外，其他都是在与人交手。这人...=All of these stone carvings, except for the first one, which was in cultivation, were fighting someone. This person...
料想如是。可惜不知这洞府刚设下时是怎么一副光景。=That's what I thought. It's a shame I don't know what the cave looked like when it was first set up.
这是对前几幅石刻的内容感兴趣？=Is this an interest in the content of the first few stone carvings?
好歹是一派宗师，能让她留在石刻中，料想不是什么平凡之辈。老夫对之感兴趣也很正常。=At least she is a sect master, and if she can make her stay in the stone carvings, it is expected that she is not an ordinary person. It's only natural that the old man would be interested in it.
这洞府主既有办法留下这三道剑气，应该也有办法让那些石刻保存更久才是。恐怕只是觉得没必要罢了。=This cave master has the means to leave these three sword qi, should also have the means to make those stone carvings to be preserved for a longer period of time. I'm afraid I just don't see the need.
不好说...=I can't say...
我倒是在想之前那道结合了木灵气的剑气。=I was rather thinking about the sword qi that combined wood aura earlier.
宁州擅长木属性神通的只有竹山宗，但门下弟子极少有剑修，甚至没听说过有相关神通流传。=The only one in Ningzhou that specialized in wood-attribute aptitudes was the Bamboo Mountain Sect, but very few of its disciples were sword cultivators, and they hadn't even heard of any related aptitudes being passed down.
先不说修士本就四处历练。武痴者，逐强者而行。这洞府主去哪挑战都不奇怪，甚至来宁州也只是为了挑战金虹剑派的剑仙罢了。=Let's not talk about the fact that cultivators already travel around. Martial obsessives traveled by the strongest. It wasn't strange for this Cave Master to go anywhere to be challenged, even coming to Ning Zhou just to challenge the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect's Sword Immortal.
有几分道理。那这魔剑难道是血剑宫的修士？=There are a few things that make sense. Then is this devil sword a cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace?
看这剑意确实可能来自血剑宫修士，但与老夫见过的血剑宫神通并不一致，也许只是有些关联罢了。=Seeing that this sword intent may indeed come from a Blood Sword Palace cultivator, but it is not consistent with the Blood Sword Palace divine abilities that I have seen, so perhaps it is just somewhat related.
这洞府主与那邪修交手也不知是多少年前了，血剑宫神通有些变化也很正常。=It is also unknown how many years ago that this Cave Lord fought with that evil cultivator, and it is normal for the Blood Sword Palace Avatar to have some changes.
魏无极点点头，然后陷入了沉默中。=Wei Wuji nodded, then fell into silence.
还有一点我很在意...这石刻上的修士起初用的神通似乎与那邪修有几分相似，到最后一幅石刻方有些改变。=There's one more thing I'm concerned about... The cultivator on this stone carving at first used a divine ability that seemed to be somewhat similar to that evil cultivator, and then the last stone carving changed a bit.
老夫正是在想这点，但我们知道的还是太少，前几幅石刻又被侵蚀严重，难以下定论。=The old man was thinking exactly about this point, but we still know too little, and the first few stone carvings are so badly eroded that it's hard to draw any conclusions.
罢了，还是再往后看看吧。=It's just a matter of looking further back.
前方是一间朴素的石室。正中间有个残破的坐垫，四周杂乱地堆了许多不知道是什么的物事。=Ahead was a plain stone room. There was a tattered cushion in the middle of it, and many objects of unknown origin were cluttered around it.
炼器室=alchemy room
啧，还以为能有些什么好东西，结果全是些失去灵性的炼器材料。=Tsk, I thought there could be some good stuff, but it turned out to be all refining materials that had lost their spirituality.
你也不想想这些东西都堆在这多久了，能剩点什么有用的反而比较奇怪吧。=You don't think about how long all this stuff has been piled up here, it's rather strange to have anything useful left instead, isn't it?
丫头你也不想想这些东西都堆在这多久了，能剩点什么有用的反而比较奇怪吧。=GirlYou don't think about how long all this stuff has been piled up here, it's rather strange to have anything useful left instead, isn't it?
这坐垫倒是还未彻底腐朽，只可惜也没什么价值。=The cushion was not completely rotten, but it was just a shame that it wasn't worth much.
等等，这中间是？=Wait, in the middle of this?
你从坐垫的隔层中拿出一颗深海章鱼牙，看其散发出的强大气息，应该是=You take out a deep-sea octopus tooth from the compartment of the cushion, and judging by the powerful aura it gives off, it should be
材料。它虽然漫长岁月中流失了许多灵性，但好在本身蕴含的能量十分强大，还可以用来炼制=Material. It has lost much of its spirituality over the long years, but the good thing is that the energy it contains is so powerful that it can still be used to refine the
你从坐垫的隔层中拿出一颗深海章鱼牙，看其散发出的强大气息，应该是六品材料。它虽然漫长岁月中流失了许多灵性，但好在本身蕴含的能量十分强大，还可以用来炼制法宝。=You take out a deep-sea octopus tooth from the compartment of the cushion, and judging by the powerful aura it gives off, it should be 6th ClassMaterial. It has lost much of its spirituality over the long years, but the good thing is that the energy it contains is so powerful that it can still be used to refine theMagic Treasure. 
不错不错，没白来这一趟，就是可惜太少了暂时也起不到什么作用。=Not bad, not a wasted trip, it's just a shame it's too small to be of much use for now.
哼，这等材料有就不错了，还挑三拣四的。=Hmph, it's good to have this kind of material, but you're still picking and choosing.
1.4百=1.4 hundred
/6.5百=/6.5 hundred
1.4百万/6.5百万=1.4 hundredm/6.5 hundredm
似乎都是些剑胚？似乎炼器手法不怎么样，全都浪费了，可惜可惜。=They all seem to be sword embryos? They don't seem to be very good at smithing, so it's a pity that they're all wasted.
侧室=sideroom

你简单地翻了翻成列的=You briefly look through the columns of
，发现两把相似的飞剑。=, found two similar flying swords.
你简单地翻了翻成列的法宝，发现两把相似的飞剑。=You briefly look through the columns ofMagic Treasure, found two similar flying swords.
其中一把似乎还完好，而另一把剑柄破损，剑身也只剩了一半，明然是无法再次使用了。=One of them seemed to be intact, while the other had a broken hilt and only half of its blade left, clearly unable to be used again.
这把飞剑倒是挺有意思，破成这样依旧能让老夫感受到原本的强大。=This flying sword is quite interesting, broken like this it can still make old me feel the original power.
炼制的手法也不错，可惜了。还好另一把看起来不错，没白跑一趟。=Nice refining too, shame. Luckily the other one looks good, not a wasted trip.
循着你的目光，魏无极显然也注意到了它。=Following your gaze, Wei Wuji apparently noticed it as well.
确实不错，便宜你=It's really good. It's cheap.
这是一间朴素的石室。但不知为何让你觉得看起来有些奇怪。=It's a plain stone room. But somehow it makes you think it looks a little strange.
你迈入石室顿时感觉空间一阵翻涌，像是身处云海幻雾中一般，看不真切附近的环境。=You stepped into the stone room immediately felt a flurry of space, like being in a sea of clouds and mist, not really able to see the environment in the vicinity.
四周一片寂静，并没有任何回应，甚至连魏无极的声音也未出现。=There was silence all around, and there was no response, not even Wei Wuji's voice appeared.
老头，你有什么想法么？=You got any ideas, old man?
啧，没有老头突然还有点不习惯呢。=Gee, it's kinda hard to get used to not having an old man all of a sudden.
”颂！“="Ode! "
没让你寂寞太久，一道剑气从你脸侧呼啸而过，一道女性修士的身影也在不远处显现。=Not letting you be lonely for too long, a sword qi whistles past the side of your face, and a female cultivator's silhouette appears not far away.
在The Great Hall of the Clan担任长老处理宗门事宜=Serving as an elder in The Great Hall of the Sect.
随着战斗的持续，那道身影旁的剑气愈来愈多，她的架势也越来越凌厉，仿佛要将整个空间都斩开。=As the battle continued, the sword qi beside that figure grew more and more, and her stance became more and more severe, as if she wanted to cut through the entire space.
虽然很想见识她最终的一剑，但你更渴望胜利！=As much as you'd like to see her final sword, you're more eager to win!
“簌簌簌”="Rustling."
随着那道身影的消散，原本凝结的剑气也化作灵液从空中滴下，汇聚在洞府的地面上。=As the figure dissipated, the originally condensed sword qi also turned into spiritual liquid that dripped down from the air and converged on the floor of the cave.
幻境消散了，但洞府内依旧是一片氤氲。=The illusion dissipated, but the cave remained dense.
真想见识一下祖师的全部实力，可惜了。=I wish I could have seen the full strength of my ancestor, but it's a shame.
，怎样？=How's that?
丫头，怎样？=GirlHow's that?
嗯，我战胜她了，虽然只是祖师的一道幻影。=Well, I defeated her, though it was only a phantom of the Ancestor.
刚才...等等，这是什么声音？=Just now... Wait, what's that sound?
“咚咚”="Knock knock."
不好！刚才的战斗抽光了阵法的能量，洞府要塌了！=It's no good! The battle just now drained the energy from the formation, the cave is going to collapse!
有啥好担心的，大不了挖个洞出去就好了。=There's nothing to worry about. Big deal. Just dig a hole and get out.
嘴上虽是这么说，但这里毕竟是门派后山，要是灰头土脸地被门中弟子撞上总得丢几分颜面甚至被当成修炼之余的谈资笑料。=Although the mouth is so say, but here after all is the sect of the back of the mountain, if dusty face by the door in the disciples always have to lose a few points of face or even be used as a cultivation after the talk of the joke.
扫视一圈石室后，你将石室中唯一看起来有价值的物品拎在手上，而后运起遁术离开了洞府。=After scanning around the stone room, you carry the only item in the room that looks valuable in your hand, while you use your Transportation Technique to leave the cave.
金虹驻地=Jinhong Resident
金虹神剑=Golden Rainbow Sword
离开了坍塌的洞府后，你方才空下来打量手上的物品。=After leaving the collapsed cave, you square off to survey the items in your hands.
这是一颗猩红色的宝珠，鲜艳的颜色让其看起来似乎内部有血煞之气流转，但你将之握在手上并没有任何不适感，反而感觉有些温热。=It was a scarlet red treasure pearl, the bright color made it look as if there was blood-devouring Qi flowing inside, but you didn't feel any discomfort when you held it in your hand, instead it felt a little warm.
这凤血珠似乎是那洞府阵法的阵眼，也不知是否有何特殊之处。=This phoenix blood bead seemed to be the eye of that cave formation, and I didn't know if there was anything special about it.
嗯...至少作为=Hmmm... At least as

展开神识探查而去，原来是两名巡山的弟子——一名是筑基境界，另一名也是筑基境界。=Expanding his divine sense and probing away, it turned out to be two disciples patrolling the mountain - one was at the Foundation Establishment realm and the other was also at the Foundation Establishment realm.
灵药园=The Garden of the Spirit Medicines
小树林=grove
长老洞府=senior concubine
碧幽潭=green pool
山脚村庄=Foothill villages
咳，倒不是肯定说会有危险。=Ahem, not that it would be dangerous for sure.
来这边，别被长老发现我们在议论这些。=Come this way. Don't let the elders find out we're talking about this.
那边是枯木林，听说是门中年纪最大的金丹长老的洞府之所在。这位长老据说活了上千年，但是不知为何一直卡在瓶颈未能突破元婴，也因此脾气非常古怪。=Over there is the Deadwood Forest, which is said to be the cave of the oldest Jindan Elder in the sect. This elder is said to have lived for thousands of years, but for some reason has been stuck at the bottleneck and has not been able to break through to the YuanYing, and as a result has a very eccentric temper.
早些日子若是闯了进去最多就是挨一顿骂，但前几月有几个=Earlier in the day if you broke in you would have gotten a scolding at most, but a couple of months ago there were a couple of
路过枯木林被枯木长老抓了去做苦力，至今还未放回来，也不知道现在怎么样了。=Passing through the Deadwood Forest was captured by the Deadwood Elder to do hard labor, and has not yet been released back, and I do not know how it is now.

多一事不如少一事，我们还是去那边巡逻吧。=More trouble than it's worth. Let's just go over there and patrol.
那俩修士将话题转到修炼上，有一搭没一搭地闲聊着远去了。=The two cultivators changed the topic to cultivation and went far away with a casual conversation.
枯木长老...似乎未曾听其他长老提起过，也不知道是何许人。至少听刚才的弟子所言，枯木长老和失踪有些关系，我那=Elder Deadwood... I don't seem to have heard the other elders mention it, and I don't know who it is. At least from what the disciple said just now, Elder Deadwood has some connection to the disappearance, my that
的朋友莫不也是被其抓去做苦力才误了约定？=I'm not sure if my friend was also taken by him to do hard labor before he missed his appointment.

At least from what the disciple said just now, Elder Deadwood has some connection to the disappearance, my thatdaoistI'm not sure if my friend was also taken by him to do hard labor before he missed his appointment.
若真是如此...倒还真有些麻烦，希望这枯木不要太难缠吧。=If that's the case... I hope this dead wood is not too difficult to deal with.
方壶山本是郁郁葱葱，草木繁茂，但此地却是枯木林立，死气满溢。=Square Pot Mountain was originally lush and green, with flourishing grass and trees, but this place was full of dead trees and dead air.
若不说此处便是方壶山，外人绝不可能想到这片树叶凋残之林是竹山宗的辖地。=If you don't say that this is Fanghu Mountain, outsiders would never think that this leafy forest is the jurisdiction of the Bamboo Mountain Sect.
这枯木林...为何会如此凋敝？若说上次来是一片枯林，现在这样子说是一片死地也不为过...=This deadwood forest... Why is it so withered? If we said it was a dead forest last time we came, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say it's a dead land now...
越往深处走，这林中的风景越发与方壶山格格不入。=The deeper we went, the more the scenery in this forest was out of place in Fanghu Mountain.
方壶山中只有修士居住，大都与鸟兽相安无事，故生态与其他山脉相差不多，甚至由于浓厚的灵气与稳定的气候，山中鸟兽品种较之外界更为丰富。=Only cultivators live in the Square Pot Mountain, and most of them are at peace with the birds and beasts, so the ecology is similar to other mountain ranges, and even due to the thick spiritual qi and stable climate, the birds and beasts in the mountain are more varied than the outside world.
这里却只有死寂。=Instead, there is only dead silence here.
不是完全没有声音的那种死寂。风从干枯的树干中穿过时，“呜呜”的呼啸声一直常伴左右，甚至听得你有些厌烦。=It's not a dead silence. The "whistling" of the wind as it passes through the dry trunks of the trees is a constant companion, even to the point where you get a little tired of hearing it.
但也仅此而已。=But that's about it.
不多时，你便已是快要接近枯木林的中心——所谓“枯木老祖”的洞府。=In a short while, you are already approaching the center of the Deadwood Forest - the so-called "Deadwood Ancestor's" cave.
是我错觉么...靠近这洞府后，似乎隐约感觉到有魔气存在。=Is it my illusion... After approaching this cave, I seem to vaguely sense the presence of a demonic aura.
你停下脚步，细细感知了一会，刚才引起你注意的魔气早已逸散，再难察觉。=You stop and carefully perceive for a moment, the demonic aura that caught your attention just now has long since escaped, and it is difficult to detect any longer.
嗯...过于稀薄，暂时不能下定论，还是先在附近看看吧。=Hmm... It's too thin to draw any conclusions for now, so let's just take a look around the neighborhood.
稍后再来=Come back later.
看来只能进洞府找线索了。=Looks like we'll just have to go into the cave and look for clues.
正当你思考如何进入洞府探查时，有两个=Just as you're thinking about how to enter the cave to explore, there are two
修士手持令牌准备进入洞府。=The cultivator held the token and prepared to enter the cave.
正当你思考如何进入洞府探查时，有两个筑基期修士手持令牌准备进入洞府。=Just as you're thinking about how to enter the cave to explore, there are twoFoundation EstablishmentThe cultivator held the token and prepared to enter the cave.
于是你灵机一动，收敛气息欲随其后突破洞府的外围阵法。=So you have the bright idea to collect your breath to break through the outer formation of the cave.
你感受到一道约摸=You feel an approximate
修士的神识探查扫过，显然是没能发现你的存在，于是阵法裂开一道门户，放你们进入其中。=The cultivator's divine sense probing swept through, apparently failing to detect your presence, so the formation cracked open a portal, releasing you all into it.
你感受到一道约摸金丹后期修士的神识探查扫过，显然是没能发现你的存在，于是阵法裂开一道门户，放你们进入其中。=You feel an approximateLate Golden CoreThe cultivator's divine sense probing swept through, apparently failing to detect your presence, so the formation cracked open a portal, releasing you all into it.
这洞府并不大，乍看之下似乎没什么特殊之处。=The cave was not large, and at first glance there seemed to be nothing special about it.
但你已看破洞府阵法的结构，不难发现其中暗室的位置。=But you have already seen through the structure of the cave formation, and it is not difficult to discover the location of the dark room in it.
从暗门进入拾级而下，不久后在你面前出现一间巨大的被魔气充盈的石室。=Enter through the hidden door and pick up the stairs, shortly after a huge magic-filled stone room appears before you.
（这魔气浓度...他们是在这地下弄了个天魔眼么？）=(This concentration of demonic energy... Did they make a heavenly devil's eye under the ground?)
惊讶之余你展开神识探查。=Surprised you unfold your divine sense to investigate.
（三个金丹修士，若干筑基修士...这都算的上个中小门派的规模了吧？）=(Three Jindan cultivators, a number of foundation cultivators... This is the size of a small to medium sized sect, right?)
（这枯木老祖私通魔教就算了，在洞府里弄这么个阵仗是想干什么？）=(Even if this old man Kukki is in league with the Devil Cult, what does he want to make such a scene in his cave?)
未等你想太多，两位金丹修士的对话便是吸引了你的注意力。=Before you think too much, the conversation between the two Jindan cultivators attracts your attention.
这批丹药还要多久？=How long will this batch of pills take?
炼制只需半月即可，但现在材料不足，光是凑材料都不知要耗费多久时间。=Refining would only take half a month, but now that there was a shortage of materials, there was no telling how long it would take just to get the materials together.
哼，我跟你们交易是为了续命，若是引起门派注意，第一个被处理的就是我。=Hmph, I'm trading with you to renew my life, if I draw the attention of the sect, I'll be the first to be dealt with.
劝你还是收了这个心思，若是没我给你们提供的据点，你们天魔道想要在宁州落脚可没那么容易。=I advise you to put that away, without the stronghold I provided you with, it wouldn't be so easy for your Heavenly Demon Dao to land in Ningzhou.
似乎上次来过的那个金丹修士便是被玄道宗出手击杀了吧。他最好死透一点，不然我们都讨不了好。=It seems that the Jindan cultivator who came last time was killed by the Xuan Dao Sect. He'd better be dead or we'll all be in deep shit.
哈哈，枯木兄多虑了，我只是怕进度太慢耽误你而已。=Haha, Brother Deadwood is overly concerned, I'm just afraid that the progress is too slow to delay you.
嘴上说的好听，你最好是这么想的，若是我寿元耗尽，这据点定是保不住，你们最好...=You'd better think so, if my lifespan runs out, this stronghold will definitely not be preserved, you'd better...
理会得，理会得。=Heeded, heeded.
那两人又低声说了些什么，但你的注意力已经转移到数位筑基修士围坐之处。=Those two whispered something else, but your attention has already shifted to where several Foundation Establishment cultivators are sitting around.
只见一群修士围坐在一个巨大的丹炉旁边，而那丹炉之中隐隐有灵气逸出，在这满是魔气的石室里反而显得有些别扭。=One could only see a group of cultivators sitting around a huge dan furnace, and there was a hidden aura escaping from that dan furnace, which instead looked a bit awkward in this stone room full of demonic aura.
料想这就是枯木老祖和那魔修方才讨论的丹药了。=It was expected that this was the elixir that Old Man Deadwood and that demonic cultivator were discussing just now.
（这么巨大的丹炉，还需要数个筑基修士协同...这炼的是什么？）=(Such a huge dan furnace and the need for several Foundation Establishment cultivators to collaborate... What is this refining?)
你展开神识探查而去。=You expand your divine sense to probe away.
（似乎有些微弱的神识波动，这炉子里炼制的难道是？）=(There seems to be some faint fluctuation of divine sense, is what's being refined in this furnace?)
你心底已经有了猜测，再结合这里都是魔修，你对自己的猜测很有把握。=You already have a guess in the back of your mind, and combined with the fact that this place is full of demonic cultivators, you're pretty sure of your guess.
（毕竟都答应下来了，希望还有救吧。）=(After all, it's all promised, so let's hope there's still a way to save it.)
秉承着对魔修下手没必要手下留情的原则，你凝聚灵力，先手偷袭了靠近丹炉的魔修。只听一声巨响，围着丹炉的好几个低阶魔修在余波下立时暴毙。=Adhering to the principle that there is no need to show mercy to demon cultivators, you condense your spiritual energy and sneak attack the demon cultivators close to the furnace first. Only a loud bang is heard, and several low-ranked demonic cultivators surrounding the dan furnace immediately die violently under the aftershocks.
不过数个=But a few
，为首的魔修已经毙命当场，另一个见势不妙早已运起某种燃血遁术化作一道红光迅速远去。=The leader of the devil cultivator has been killed on the spot, another see the situation is not good has already transported some kind of blood recluse art into a red light quickly far away.
不过数个回合，为首的魔修已经毙命当场，另一个见势不妙早已运起某种燃血遁术化作一道红光迅速远去。=But a fewRoundsThe leader of the devil cultivator has been killed on the spot, another see the situation is not good has already transported some kind of blood recluse art into a red light quickly far away.
那枯木老祖也不愧是活了上千年，虽然战斗力不怎么样但是保命手段却是不错，等你击毙魔修他也是强行催动遁术朝另一角远遁。=That withered wood old ancestor is also worthy of living thousands of years, although the combat power is not good but the means of preservation is good, such as you killed the devil repair he is also forced to urge the recluse toward another corner of the far away.
这遁术着实诡异，他又占了先机，你竟一时追不上只好吊在后面，慢慢拉近距离。=This recluse is really weird, and he took the lead, you can't catch up with it, so you have to hang back and slowly close the distance.
你一路追着枯木老祖，两人的差距在不断缩小。=You chased after Old Man Deadwood all the way, and the gap between the two of you was narrowing.
眼见你即将抓住他，后者却冲向一处洞府。=When you see that you are about to catch him, the latter rushes towards a cave.
！救我！=! - Help me! Help me!
明山师兄！救我！=Mingshansenior brother! - Help me! Help me!
他一边用干枯的喉咙喊出嘶哑的声音，一边迎头撞向那洞府入口。=He shouted out a hoarse voice through his parched throat while slamming headlong into the entrance of that cave.
“嘭”="Boom."
枯木似乎撞在了什么阵法上，荡起一阵涟漪。=The dead wood seemed to hit some kind of formation, sending a ripple.
即已是证据确凿，你也不担心他能作出什么妖，凌空洞府前静观事态发展。=That is, it is already evidence, you do not worry about what he can make what the demon, Lingkong cave before the quiet to watch the development of the situation.
见此情形，那枯木也像是溺水的凡人抓住了救命稻草一般，卖力地嘶吼着。=Seeing this situation, that dead wood also looked like a drowning mortal grabbing a life preserver, hissing vigorously.
而那洞府中久久未有声响传来，只有阵法上激起的波澜默默地回应这枯木老祖。=And that cave has not sounded for a long time, only the ripples stirred up on the array silently responded to this old man withered wood.
枯木老祖的丑态看得你有些好笑，也让你不打算再观望下去。=The withered wood old man's ugly demeanor looked a bit funny to you, and it also made you not intend to watch any longer.
看来你是搬不到救兵了，还是老老实实回答我的问题吧，说不定还...=It looks like you can't move to save your life, so why don't you just answer my questions honestly and maybe even...
！我可是唯一陪你活到现在的=I'm the only one who's lived with you this long! I'm the only one who's lived with you this long.
！你真要见死不救么！=You really want to see death? You're really going to die trying to save me!
明山！我可是唯一陪你活到现在的师弟！你真要见死不救么！=MingshanI'm the only one who's lived with you this long! I'm the only one who's lived with you this long.Junior discipleYou really want to see death? You're really going to die trying to save me!
这次阵法终于有了些动静，甚至有些大。=This time the formation finally made some noise, even a little loud.
只见阵法缓缓散去，其中的竹林也不知为何退向两边，一条曲折的小径从中显现。=Only to see the formation slowly dispersing, in which the bamboo forests also somehow retreated to the sides, and a winding path emerged from it.
“何人在此扰我清修？”="Who is here to disturb my purification?"
随着阵法解除，一道身影出现洞府之前。=As the formation was lifted, a figure appeared before the cave.
此人身着一件粗布长袍，脚踩竹木拖鞋，手上还拎着一把成色不错的洒水壶。说是不错，其实也不过是凡物而已，没有经过炼制，也不会有什么独特的神通。=This person was dressed in a rough cloth robe, with bamboo wooden slippers on his feet, and a sprinkling pot of good color in his hand. It was said to be good, but in fact it was nothing more than a mortal object, it had not been refined and would not have any unique magical abilities.
要说有什么特殊的话，大概是其材质有些不一般。=If there is anything special about it, it's probably that its material is somewhat unusual.
原材料至少是=Raw materials are at least
以上的矿石，若是等价换成此人身上的粗布长袍和竹木拖鞋，也能能够竹山宗上下穿用百年以上。=Above the ore, if the equivalent price is exchanged for the coarse cloth robe and bamboo wooden slippers on this person's body, it can also be able to Bamboo Mountain Sect up and down to wear more than a hundred years.

枯木老祖充满怨念的笑声如浪潮般席卷了这片静谧的山脉，一时间整片林海都因之震颤不已。=The grudge-filled laughter of the Withered Wood Old Ancestor swept over this quiet mountain range like a wave, and for a time, the entire forest and sea trembled because of it.

你确认无恙后，联系了门中其他长老送他们返还宗门。自己则是继续寻找魔门遗留的线索。=After you confirmed that you were unharmed, you contacted the other elders of the sect to send them back to the sect. On your own, you continued to search for the clues left behind by the Devil Sect.
可惜的是除那些低阶魔修的尸体外，你再无发现。=Unfortunately you find nothing more except for the bodies of those low-ranked demonic cultivators.
方前交手之时，你已确认出现于此的魔修来自天魔道，虽无更多信息，但略一思考后也能明白魔门居心何在。=When we fought before, you have already confirmed that the devil cultivator who appeared here is from the Heavenly Devil Road, although there is no more information, but after a little thought, you can also understand what the devil's intention is.

宗门大比大比=The Great Sect Competition

你感受到一道与你不相上下的神识探查扫过，为防打草惊蛇，你赶忙敛息驻足。=You feel a divine sense probe that is not similar to yours sweeping through, and in order to prevent spooking the snakes, you hasten to gather your breath and stop.
虽然没有引起那修士的注意，但也错失了进入阵法的良机。=Although he didn't attract the cultivator's attention, he also missed a good opportunity to enter the formation.
这枯木老祖虽然只是金丹修士，但他洞府外围的阵法却是十分复杂，甚至让你有些摸不着门道。=Although this withered wood old ancestor is only a Jindan cultivator, the array formation on the periphery of his cave is very complex, and even makes you a little puzzled.
尝试一番后你只得悻然放弃。=After a few attempts you just give up with resentment.
我没有把握进入洞府，还是准备一下再来吧。=I'm not sure I can get into the cave, so I'd better prepare and come back.
等待=wait for
谅解。=Understanding.
好不容易有位师弟通过测试，我赶着带他面见师姐，故还未曾测过，望师姐谅解。=Finally, a junior passed the test. I rushed to take him to meet my senior, so I haven't taken the test yet. I hope senior will forgive me.
远远观瞧，只见广场接取任务的地方，围了不少的人。=Looking from a distance, I saw a lot of people surrounding the square where the mission was received.
奇了怪了，那里怎么这么热闹。=It's strange why it's so lively there.
魏无极捋了捋胡子，意味深长地轻叹了一声。=Wei Wuji stroked his beard and sighed meaningfully.
随身姐姐=portable sister
也好，谨慎一点总没错。=Well, it's always right to be cautious.
这位修士有些激动，眨巴着眼睛看着你，似乎在等待你的反应，你有些莫名其妙。=The monk was a little excited and blinked at you, as if waiting for your reaction. You were a little confused.
云秋兰啊！云家你都不知道？真是稀奇...我明白了，你定是这几年刚入门的弟子吧。=Yun Qiulan! You don’t even know about the Yun family? It's really strange...I understand, you must be a new disciple in the past few years.
之前我教封山之事，这你总知道吧。当年掌门为了安心闭关，特地封山肃反戡乱，揪出古神教的奸细。=I taught you about the mountain closure before, you must know this. At that time, in order to retreat with peace of mind, the leader specially sealed the mountain to suppress the rebellion and uncovered the spies of the Ancient God Sect.
而这云清正，就是先前古神教安插在化尘教最大的奸细，干过的坏事，那是罄竹难书，后来据说和他妻子一起畏罪潜逃，生死不明。=And this Yun Qingzheng was the biggest spy planted by the Ancient God Sect in the Huachen Sect. He had done countless bad things, and it was said that he and his wife fled together in fear of crime, and their life and death were unknown.
真是想不到，云清正可是以前化尘教的中流砥柱，大家都很信任他们......竟然害死那么多同门。=It’s really unbelievable that Yun Qingzheng was the mainstay of the Huachen Sect in the past, and everyone trusted them... but he actually killed so many of his fellow disciples.
有的交头接耳着，有的则在冷眼旁观。而很明显的是，有几个家伙嗓门最大。=Some were whispering to each other, while others were watching indifferently. And obviously, there are a few guys who have the loudest voices.
同门们！她就是云秋兰！是那个大叛徒的后人！=Fellow disciples! She is Yun Qiulan! They are the descendants of that great traitor!
她可是云秋兰！云家的后人！你知道吗！当年她父亲云清正害死了多少我们的人？=She is Yun Qiulan! Descendants of the Yun family! do you know! How many of our people did her father Yun Qingzheng kill back then?
她父亲可是当年化尘教最大的奸细！叛徒！现在还在逍遥法外！=Her father was the biggest spy of Huachen Sect back then! traitor! Still on the loose now!
呵，我没记错的话，你们几个早就劣迹斑斑了吧！屡教不改，可是要逐出宗门的。不过我可以做主，在大家面前，给你们一个坦白的机会。=Ha, if I remember correctly, you guys have already been full of misdeeds! Those who refuse to change despite repeated admonitions will be expelled from the sect. But I can make the decision and give you a chance to confess in front of everyone.
我不服！=I'm not convinced!
一道尖细的声音将澹台仙无礼地打断，一时全场鸦雀无声=A high-pitched voice interrupted Tantai Xian rudely, and the whole place was silent for a moment.
别...别说了，你快别说了...=Stop... stop talking, stop talking soon...
不行，我就是不服！云秋兰明明是叛徒之后，却能安然无恙地生活在化尘教，享受那么好的资源，甚至有机会直接进入内门，凭什么！难道就是因为资质好吗？那他父母的事情呢？就这么放过她了吗？=No, I just don’t accept it! After Yun Qiulan was clearly a traitor, she was able to live in the Huachen Sect safely, enjoy such good resources, and even have the opportunity to directly enter the inner sect. Why! Is it just because of good qualifications? What about his parents? Just let her go?
各位同门，云秋兰虽是罪人之后，但其父亲受到指控之时，她不过还是个十岁的孩子。=Fellow disciples, although Yun Qiulan is a criminal queen, she was only a ten-year-old child when her father was accused.
多谢澹台前辈解围，不然此事我还真不知该如何收场。在下这就把此次任务的玉简发放给诸位同门。=Thank you, Senior Tantai, for rescuing me. Otherwise, I really don’t know how this matter would have ended. I will now distribute the jade slips for this mission to all my fellow disciples.
不远处，正在打瞌睡的执事慌不迭地放出了护体法器，睡意全无，随即着急忙慌地带着几个炼器弟子前去施法救火。=Not far away, the deacon who was dozing off hurriedly released the body protection magic weapon. He was completely sleepless, and then he hurriedly led several weapon refining disciples to cast spells to put out the fire.
前往风雷谷采集五个凝神玉髓，或前往广陵城百宝行采购，集齐后交至神兵阁执事。=Go to Fenglei Valley to collect five Concentrating Chalcedony, or go to Guangling City Baobao Shop to purchase them. After collecting them all, hand them over to the deacon of Shenbing Pavilion.
澹台仙奉长老之命在实验某种神秘炼器之法，需要你的帮助。=Tantai Immortal is experimenting with some mysterious weapon refining method under the orders of the elders and needs your help.
澹台之需=Tantai needs
正阳兽潮=Zhengyang Beast Tide
前往正阳山驻地协助澹台仙。=Go to Zhengyang Mountain Station to assist Tantai Xian.
澹台仙奉命在正阳山平定兽潮，需要你的帮助。=Tantai Immortal was ordered to quell the beast tide in Zhengyang Mountain and needs your help.
来到正阳山，此地早已没有了往日的平静。极目远眺，似乎有浓重的杀气隐隐袭来。天上一道道土黄色的遁光接连不断，是守卫后山的化尘教弟子们。=Arriving at Zhengyang Mountain, this place no longer has the peace it used to have. Looking far into the distance, there seemed to be a strong murderous aura coming faintly. The streaks of earthy yellow light in the sky are the disciples of the Huachen Sect guarding the back mountain.
正在你观察之际，不远处有两道遁光向你飞来。=While you are observing, there are two escaping lights flying towards you not far away.
前辈可是前来支援的？=Senior came to support?
你出示了澹台仙留给你的传音符，验明无误后二人向你作了一揖。=You showed the transmission talisman that Tantai Immortal left for you. After verifying that it was correct, the two of them bowed to you.
正在寒暄之际，一道传音符从远处飞射而来，二人传阅之后脸色微变，为首之人开口说道。=While they were chatting, a transmission note flew from a distance. After the two passed it around, their expressions changed slightly, and the leader spoke.
前辈，情况有变，我等还有要事在身，恕不奉陪。时间紧迫，还请您尽快与澹台师姐汇合。=Senior, the situation has changed and I have important matters to attend to, so I won't be able to accompany you. Time is running out, so please meet up with Senior Sister Tantai as soon as possible.
进入驻地，此处显得十分混乱，百余名化尘弟子正匆忙地布置着什么。=Entering the station, the place seemed very chaotic, with more than a hundred Huachen disciples hurriedly arranging something.
你飞身进入主帐，澹台仙正在和数位筑基期修士紧张研讨着战术，看到你到来，神色一喜。=You flew into the main tent, where Tantai Immortal was intensely discussing tactics with several foundation-building monks. He looked happy when he saw you arriving.
啊，真是太及时了，这样一来，此事更是十拿九稳了。=Ah, it's so timely. In this way, this matter is even more certain.
澹台道友客气了，不知现在战况如何？=Fellow Daoist Tantai is so polite. I wonder what the current situation is like?
时间紧迫，那我们便长话短说。=Time is of the essence, so let’s keep the story short.
数月前，正阳山遭遇了近年最大的推山兽兽潮。为防止后山各驻地受灾，我与秋兰等人奉命率百余外门弟子前来镇守。=A few months ago, Zhengyang Mountain encountered the largest tide of mountain-moving beasts in recent years. In order to prevent the various garrison stations in the back mountain from being damaged, Qiulan and I were ordered to lead more than a hundred outer disciples to guard the area.
起初此事并不危急，毕竟推山兽的习性我们素有所知，炼气期的推山兽并无灵智，迁徙不过是顺应自然而已。=At first, this matter was not critical. After all, we all know the habits of the Mountain Pushing Beast. The Mountain Pushing Beast in the Qi Refining Stage has no intelligence, and its migration is just to follow nature.
故我等以引导、疏散为方针，着重据守各紧要据点，耐心等待他们迁徙完成。=Therefore, we use guidance and evacuation as our goals, focus on holding on to key strongholds, and wait patiently for their migration to be completed.
然而，推山兽们并未像往常一样离开，而是留在此地，随着时间推移，它们越来越活跃，越来越凶狠。以至于后来每日都有弟子伤亡、失踪。=However, the mountain-pushing beasts did not leave as usual, but stayed here. As time went by, they became more and more active and fierce. As a result, disciples were killed, injured, or missing every day.
不久之前，我与秋兰道友一同探查发现，有许多筑基期乃至金丹期妖兽潜藏在兽潮之中，数量不明。=Not long ago, my Taoist friend Qiulan and I investigated together and found that there were many foundation-building and even golden elixir-stage demonic beasts lurking in the beast tide, and the number was unknown.
仅凭我二人之力，显然无法应对，便向诸位道友发出了求援的传音符，也向宗门请求来了更多增援。=It was obvious that we could not cope with it with just the strength of the two of us, so I sent out a transmission note to all fellow Taoists asking for help, and also requested more reinforcements from the sect.
而目前情况则出现了进一步的恶化，推山兽的进攻越来越频繁，越来越集中。经过这几天的交锋，他们数量和境界比我们想象得还要强大。=The current situation has deteriorated further, and the Mountain Pushing Beast's attacks are becoming more frequent and more concentrated. After these days of confrontation, their numbers and realm are stronger than we imagined.
经过我们近日的研判，为了防止情况进一步失控，我们必须先发制人，恶战在所难免。=After our recent research and judgment, in order to prevent the situation from getting out of control further, we must strike preemptively, and a fierce battle is inevitable.
于是我教长老齐出，突然袭击以把握主动。此时正在山内进行清剿。而我们则负责在此处设下埋伏，待兽潮攻至此处，两面夹击，一举荡平。=So I taught the elders to come out together and make a sudden attack to seize the initiative. At this time, a clearing operation was underway in the mountain. We are responsible for setting up an ambush here, waiting for the beast tide to attack here, attacking from both sides, and wiping it out in one fell swoop.
但显然妖兽也明白自己的处境。就在此时此刻，推山兽正在四处出击，试图发起总攻，包围、突袭我们各后山驻地。我已下令正阳山各部低阶修士撤回所属阵地固守避战，兽潮被逼至此处只是时间问题。=But obviously the monster also understands his situation. At this moment, Tuishan Beast is attacking everywhere, trying to launch a general offensive, surrounding and raiding our various back-mountain stations. I have ordered the low-level monks from all tribes in Zhengyang Mountain to withdraw to their positions to avoid fighting. It is only a matter of time before the beast tide is forced here.
没问题了=No problem
该如何对敌？=How to deal with the enemy?
为何在这里？=Why here?
澹台仙神秘地笑了笑，看向了一旁的云秋兰，云秋兰向你施了一礼，将地图铺开。=Tantai Xian smiled mysteriously and looked at Yun Qiulan aside. Yun Qiulan saluted you and spread out the map.
自是依靠阵法对敌。=He relies on formations to fight against the enemy.
此地阵法精良，我化尘教阵法虽不善攻伐，防御可算是一流，即使是数名金丹期修士同时围攻，也要颇费一番手脚才行。=The formations here are excellent. Although our Huachen Sect's formations are not good at attacking, the defense is top-notch. Even if several Golden Core Stage monks besieged it at the same time, it would still take a lot of effort.
届时由澹台师姐主持阵法，再以其他同门在阵内加持，就更加万无一失了，理论上能加固到元婴期也难以攻破的地步。=At that time, Senior Sister Tantai will be in charge of the formation, and other disciples will be in the formation to support it, which will make it even more foolproof. In theory, it can be strengthened to the point where it is difficult to break even at the Nascent Soul stage.
只要等到推山兽主力集中此地，再由我启动此阵外的另一个巨大杀阵，它们便无处可逃了。=As long as the main force of the Mountain Pushing Beasts is concentrated here and I activate another huge killing array outside this formation, they will have nowhere to escape.
此地乃是正阳山险要之处。正阳山峥嵘险峻，流沙遍地，地势复杂，而此地便是进出的唯一要道。=This place is a dangerous place in Zhengyang Mountain. Zhengyang Mountain is steep and steep, with quicksand everywhere, and the terrain is complex, and this place is the only way in and out.
对于我们能飞行的修士来说，地形险恶算不得什么。但对于绝大多数低阶修士和妖兽来说，此地是唯一进出之处。只要把住了这里，便切断了妖兽进出正阳山的陆路。=For us monks who can fly, the terrain is nothing. But for most low-level monks and monsters, this place is the only way in and out. As long as this place is secured, the land route for monsters to enter and exit Zhengyang Mountain will be cut off.
再在此设下埋伏，迫使妖兽使出全力，我们方能以逸待劳，依靠地利人和将其一网打尽。=If we set up an ambush here and force the monsters to use all their strength, we can wait for work and rely on the right location and people to catch them all in one fell swoop.
话音未落，帐外嘈杂声起，一道通体红光的传音符射入帐中。在座的诸位道友面色凝重，纷纷起身，各自放出法宝，显然早已准备万全。=Before he finished speaking, there was a noise outside the tent, and a beam of red light shot into the tent. The fellow Taoists present looked solemn, stood up one after another, and each released their magic weapons. It was obvious that they were fully prepared.
敌已至。诸位道友，随我来！=The enemy has arrived. Fellow Taoists, come with me!
澹台仙手掐法诀，跃出帐外，你与诸位道友紧随其后。飞至高空，只见密密麻麻的推山兽自四面八方攻来，千百只有余，正在疯狂冲击着驻地的防御阵法。=Tantai Immortal pinched the magic formula with his hand and jumped out of the tent, followed closely by you and fellow Taoists. Flying to a high altitude, I saw densely packed mountain-mountain beasts attacking from all directions. There were only a few left, and they were frantically attacking the defensive formations of the station.
阵法形成的护罩在如此猛烈的冲击下，竟剧烈摇晃起来，似乎大风一吹便会飘摇而去。深知此阵威能的你们不禁倒吸一口凉气。=The shield formed by the formation shook violently under such a violent impact, as if it would drift away when the strong wind blew. Those of you who are well aware of the power of this formation can't help but take a breath of cold air.
在下先前已命诸弟子就位待命，与此地阵法相互配合。阵法由我主持，各位道友皆乃我教栋梁，见机行事即可，务必保证两处阵眼安全！=I have previously ordered all the disciples to be on standby and coordinate with this formation. I am in charge of the formation, and all fellow Taoists are the pillars of my teaching. Just act according to the situation, and be sure to ensure the safety of the two formations!
言罢澹台仙急速飞至阵眼关键处，全心全意催动起阵法来，檀眉轻皱，略显吃力。=After saying this, Tantai Immortal quickly flew to the key point of the formation, and activated the formation with all his heart. His brows furrowed slightly, showing a slight effort.
我教弟子听令，结阵！=I teach my disciples to obey orders and form formations!
澹台仙杏眼圆瞪，朗声喝道。身前光华流转，直冲霄汉，金光闪闪的穹顶自青天如覆碗般飞速罩下，随即透明下来。\r\n=Tantai Xianxing's eyes widened and he shouted loudly. The light in front of him was flowing, soaring straight into the sky. The golden dome quickly covered him from the blue sky like a bowl, and then became transparent. \r\n
同门弟子们则三三两两的排列在各阵旗旁，恨不得将自身灵力全部灌注到阵法当中。笼罩驻地的护罩一时间稳固下来，无论妖兽如何冲击都岿然不动，但从澹台仙的表情来看，显然不能支撑太久。=The fellow disciples were arranged in twos and threes beside each formation flag, eager to pour all their spiritual power into the formation. The shield covering the station stabilized for a while, and it remained unmoved no matter how the monsters attacked it. However, judging from Tantai Xian's expression, it was obvious that it could not hold up for long.
诸位道友，情况危急！我们兵分三路，一路去帮助澹师姐维持阵法，一路随我准备杀阵，剩下的人见机行事，随时支援，如何？=Fellow Taoists, the situation is critical! Our troops are divided into three groups. One group will help Senior Sister Dan maintain the formation, and the other group will follow me to prepare for the killing array. The remaining people will act according to the situation and provide support at any time. How about that?
大家并无异议，甚至无甚交流，只是交换了几下目光，便迅速分为几组，向选定的地方飞去。=Everyone had no objections or even much communication. They just exchanged a few glances and then quickly divided into several groups and flew to the chosen place.
小子咱去哪？=Where are we going, kid?
见机行事=Play it by ear
助云秋兰=Zhuyun Qiulan
助澹台仙=Help Dantai Immortal
你同几位同门一起，在云秋兰的带领下飞至杀阵阵眼旁。依天罡之位站立，布下了一个小型的防御法阵，你严阵以待，密切观察着四方动向。\r\n=Together with several of your fellow disciples, you fly to the eye of the killing array under the leadership of Yun Qiulan. Standing in Tiangang's position, you set up a small defensive formation. You stood ready and closely observed the movements in all directions. \r\n
再看澹台仙那边，数位同门已然前往支援，澹台仙子的压力大大减轻。而一旦哪里屏障薄弱了，负责机动的数位同门则会飞速前往，施法加固。=Looking at Fairy Tantai, several of her colleagues have already gone to support her, and the pressure on Fairy Tantai has been greatly reduced. Once the barrier is weak somewhere, the digital colleagues responsible for maneuvering will quickly go there and cast spells to reinforce it.
杀阵！起！=Killing array! rise!
云秋兰高声喝道，眼见远处另一个阵法倏地启动，将狂暴的推山兽尽数包围。=Yun Qiulan shouted loudly and saw another formation in the distance suddenly activated, surrounding all the violent mountain-pushing beasts.
推山兽一时更加疯狂。=Pushing the mountain beast became even crazier for a moment.
如此这般，推山兽在三次猛烈冲锋未果之后，似有退却之意。一时间，战场静的可怕。唯有千百双眼睛凶狠地盯着你们，盯得你头皮似乎隐隐有些发麻。=In this way, the Tuishan Beast seemed to be retreating after three violent charges but failed. For a moment, the battlefield was eerily quiet. There are only thousands of pairs of eyes staring at you so fiercely that your scalp seems to be numb.
环顾四周，诸位同门虽都不动声色，但皆面有疲惫。=Looking around, all the fellow disciples looked calm, but they all looked tired.
推山兽群在杀阵的攻击之下，疯狂地抵御着，很快便有溃散之势。=Under the attack of the killing formation, the Tuishan beast herd frantically resisted, and soon they were on the verge of collapse.
恰在此时，突变乍起。只见推山兽们并没有真的崩溃，而是在数百丈外突然整齐有序地组成了一只只小队，从特定的方向，将攻击轮流集中在阵法的某些点上，很快护罩便出现了数个薄弱之处。=At this moment, a sudden change occurred. I saw that the mountain-pushing beasts did not really collapse, but suddenly formed neat and orderly teams hundreds of feet away. From specific directions, they took turns to focus their attacks on certain points of the formation. The quick shield had several weak points.
这...妖兽竟如此有组织？当真是骇人听闻！=This...monster is so organized? It’s really appalling!
见此景象，众人不禁倒吸一口凉气。霎时间，维护阵法的人手便显得捉襟见肘，离得最近的几位道友立马顶上，施法加固阵法。\r\n=Seeing this scene, everyone couldn't help but take a breath. In an instant, the manpower to maintain the formation seemed to be stretched thin, and the closest fellow Taoists immediately stepped forward and cast spells to strengthen the formation. \r\n
你在澹台仙的呼唤下，飞至一处关键阵眼处，将灵力尽力输入进阵法当中。=Under Tantai Xian's call, you fly to a key formation point and try your best to input your spiritual power into the formation.
不好，有诈！=No, it’s a scam!
不知何时，远处悄悄聚集了数只实力不俗的金丹期妖兽，他们合力攻击，暴风骤雨般将灵力施放在刁钻的一点上，此处阵法霎时被撕开了一道口子。\r\n=At some point, several powerful Golden Core-stage monsters quietly gathered in the distance. They attacked together, using their spiritual power like a storm at a tricky point, where a hole was instantly ripped open in the formation. \r\n
他们横冲直撞，势不可挡，以难以反应的速度飞速冲向杀阵阵眼。仅一击竟就撕碎了此地的防御阵法。\r\n=They ran rampant, unstoppable, and rushed towards the killing formation at a speed that was difficult to react. Just one strike actually tore apart the defensive formation here. \r\n
云秋兰飞身向前，以迅雷不及掩耳之势挡在一位还未反应过来的同门身前，与凶兽缠斗在一起。\r\n=Yun Qiulan flew forward, and with lightning speed, she stood in front of a fellow disciple who had not yet reacted, and fought with the ferocious beast. \r\n
快！快把这个给秋兰，我们这里能顶住！=quick! Give this to Qiulan quickly, we can withstand it here!
澹台仙将一个环状法宝抛给了你，你稳稳当当地接住，立刻向云秋兰那里飞遁而去。\r\n=Tantai Immortal threw a ring-shaped magic weapon to you, you caught it steadily and immediately flew away to Yun Qiulan. \r\n
你遁至高空，往下俯瞰，好一番炼狱景象！炼气期的妖兽自破洞处鱼贯而入，与外门弟子战作一团。高阶妖兽则向着澹台仙和云秋兰两边冲去。\r\n=You escape to the sky and look down, what a scene of purgatory! The demonic beasts in the Qi refining stage filed in through the hole and fought with the outer disciples. The high-level monsters rushed towards Tantai Xian and Yun Qiulan. \r\n
战场之上，混战四起，澹台仙一边尽力愈合着阵法，一边操纵着杀阵。已是金丹的澹台仙此时毫不留手，展露的实力令人咂舌，一时间化尘教弟子士气大振。\r\n=On the battlefield, melee broke out. Tantai Xian tried his best to heal the formation while manipulating the killing formation. Tantai Immortal, who was already a golden elixir, showed no mercy at this time. The strength he displayed was staggering, and the morale of Huachen Sect disciples was greatly boosted. \r\n
你施展遁术，尽力躲避着敌人。然而，早已有妖兽注意到了你的存在，试图将你拦截。\r\n=You use escape skills and try your best to avoid the enemy. However, monsters have already noticed your presence and are trying to intercept you. \r\n
你将拦路的妖兽摆平，其他妖兽见状不敢为难，四散开来。你毫不犹豫，向杀阵阵眼遁去。=You smooth out the monsters blocking the road, and the other monsters don't dare to be embarrassed when they see this, and scatter in all directions. Without hesitation, you ran towards the killing formation.
而不远处，云秋兰早已麻利地将无数凶兽斩翻在地。=Not far away, Yun Qiulan had already quickly chopped countless ferocious beasts to the ground.
亭亭玉立于血污之中，一尘不染。\r\n=The slim jade stands among the blood stains, spotless. \r\n
尸横遍野。同门的，推山兽的，血肉模糊而难以分辨的...血流漂杵，你看到云秋兰坚毅的神情里似乎写满了哀伤。\r\n=Corpses littered the fields. A member of the same sect, a mountain-pushing beast, the flesh and blood are blurred and indistinguishable...the blood is flowing, and you can see that Yun Qiulan's resolute expression seems to be filled with sadness. \r\n
云道友接着！这是澹台道友让我给你送来的......\r\n=Fellow Taoist Yun continues! This is what fellow Taoist Tantai asked me to bring to you...\r\n
话音未落，一股劲风猛然从背后袭来，突变乍起！浓厚的杀意逼得你霎时汗毛倒竖，是元婴期的妖兽！\r\n=Before he finished speaking, a strong wind suddenly hit from behind, and a sudden change occurred! The strong killing intent makes your hair stand on end instantly, it’s a monster in the Nascent Soul stage! \r\n
电光火石之间，但见一道身影毫不犹豫地闪至身前，是云秋兰！！\n——她竟试图帮你挡下此击！\r=In the midst of the lightning and flint, I saw a figure flashing in front of me without hesitation, it was Yun Qiulan! ! \n——She actually tried to help you block this attack! \r
秋兰道友！=Fellow Taoist Qiulan!
只见云秋兰早已接过你递给她的法宝，在身前奋力催动起来。竟是某种引力秘宝！那元婴期的妖兽竟一时间没法再前进一步。\r=I saw that Yun Qiulan had already taken the magic weapon you handed her and started to use it in front of her. It's actually some kind of gravitational secret treasure! The Nascent Soul stage monster was unable to move forward for a while. \r
这是！？世上竟有可以操纵引力的法器！真是闻所未闻！等等...我想起来了，这就是化尘教传说中的炼器秘术，今日得见真是大开眼界！\n=This is! ? There is actually a magic weapon in the world that can control gravity! Unheard of! Wait...I remembered, this is the legendary weapon refining secret technique of Huachen Sect. It was really eye-opening to see it today! \n
道友别担心，交给我就好，有澹台姐炼制的此物，困住此兽没有问题......=Fellow Taoist, don't worry, just leave it to me. With this thing refined by Sister Tantai, there will be no problem in trapping this beast...
眼前的妖兽表情戏谑，将灵力全部聚集在掌尖的凶爪之上，凝聚成一把利刃，似乎在催动着什么。\n=The monster in front of him had a playful expression, and concentrated all its spiritual power on the vicious claws on the tip of its palm, condensing it into a sharp blade, which seemed to be moving something. \n
不好！快走！=not good! Go quickly!
你甚至都没有反应过来，云秋兰就已然将你推开。=Before you even reacted, Yun Qiulan had already pushed you away.
利刃带着恐怖的威能，刹那间便击溃了引力屏障，云秋兰手中的法器顿时暗淡下来，发出一声尖利的爆响。\r\n=The sharp blade carried terrifying power and instantly destroyed the gravitational barrier. The magic weapon in Yun Qiulan's hand suddenly dimmed and made a sharp explosion. \r\n
连引力屏障都能击溃的利刃，轻松穿透了少女的身躯。\r\n=The sharp blade that could defeat even gravity barriers easily penetrated the girl's body. \r\n
少女的身躯是那么柔弱，利刃几乎丝毫没有减速，在空中发出尖锐的哀鸣。\r\n=The girl's body was so weak, and the sharp blade barely slowed down at all, making a sharp whine in the air. \r\n
英勇如剑、坚毅如钢的云秋兰，此时像一卷洒落的丝绢，惨白、柔弱、无助、随风轻动，悠悠然飘乎而下......\r\n=Yun Qiulan, who is as brave as a sword and as strong as steel, is now like a roll of scattered silk, pale, weak, helpless, gently moving with the wind, floating down leisurely...\r\n
快...走.....=Go...go...
无人再主持外部的杀阵，一时间，远处的光幕分崩离析，推山兽们掉转方向，四散奔逃。=No one was in charge of the external killing array anymore. For a moment, the light curtain in the distance fell apart, and the mountain-pushing beasts turned around and fled in all directions.
秋兰！！！=Qiulan! ! !
见到秋兰被重伤，附近的同门迅速向此处飞来，澹台仙此时已将阵法护罩全部愈合，奋力催动着杀阵，将冲入阵线的妖兽压制。=Seeing that Qiulan was seriously injured, the nearby fellow disciples quickly flew towards here. At this time, Tantai Xian had completely healed the formation shield, and vigorously activated the killing formation to suppress the monsters that rushed into the formation.
妖兽看着远处崩毁的杀阵，露出了得逞的笑容，满目狰狞，仰天大笑。戏谑地看着你，似乎在欣赏着你的表情。\n=The monster beast looked at the collapsed killing array in the distance, showing a triumphant smile, its eyes full of ferociousness, and it looked up to the sky and laughed. He looked at you playfully, seeming to appreciate your expression. \n
救秋兰=Save Qiulan
杀妖兽=Kill monsters
你并未与其硬碰硬，你很清楚你有更重要的事情要做，你飞身前去救下重伤的云秋兰。=You did not confront him head-on. You knew very well that you had more important things to do, so you flew forward to save the seriously injured Yun Qiulan.
云秋兰向你强挤了一个笑容，便昏了过去。=Yun Qiulan forced a smile on you and then passed out.
小心！它又来了！=careful! It's here again!
你回头，只见那妖兽神情凶狠，不顾其他修士的阻挠，径直向此处飞速而来。=When you turn around, you see the monster with a ferocious look on its face. Regardless of the other monks' obstruction, it speeds towards here.
就在千钧一发之时，支援赶到！一道土黄色的遁光直直穿透护罩，飞速向此处射来！=At the critical moment, support arrived! A ray of earth-yellow light penetrated straight through the shield and shot towards here quickly!
呵，你们可当真放肆，当我化尘教无人了吗？=Oh, are you really so presumptuous that you think that I, the Transformation Sect, have no one?
恒如毫不留情，施展引力，将眼前的元婴妖兽狠狠困住，如此高强的引力，有势不可挡之势，妖兽一时只能节节败退，被打的毫无还手之力。=Heng Ru was merciless and used gravity to trap the Yuanying monster in front of him. Such a strong gravitational force was so overwhelming that the monster could only retreat step by step, being beaten without the ability to fight back.
敢伤云秋兰，可得先问问我！=If you dare to hurt Yun Qiulan, you must ask me first!
恒如恶狠狠地将法术全部倾泻在眼前的妖兽身上，妖兽只是用力地瞪着、挣扎着，直到再也无法动弹。=Heng Ru ferociously poured out all his spells on the monster in front of him, but the monster just stared and struggled until it could no longer move.
恒如向你这里看了一眼，确认云秋兰安全之后，随即又立刻开始攻击起来。=Hengru glanced at you, and after confirming that Yun Qiulan was safe, he immediately started attacking again.
犯我化尘教者，杀！=Anyone who offends my Huachen Cult shall be killed!
其他长老们也纷纷赶到，两道杀阵接连启动，化尘弟子们士气大振，跟着长老四处厮杀，一时间妖兽惨叫连连。=Other elders also arrived one after another, and two killing arrays were activated one after another. The morale of the Huachen disciples was greatly boosted, and they followed the elders to fight everywhere. The monsters screamed again and again for a while.
而这边，你用灵力托住即将坠地的云秋兰，迅速用神识查探了她的伤势。=And here, you used your spiritual power to support Yun Qiulan who was about to fall to the ground, and quickly used your spiritual consciousness to detect her injuries.
伤势并不致命，你松了一口气。准备带她到安全的地方治疗。=The injuries were not fatal and you breathed a sigh of relief. Prepare to take her to a safe place for treatment.
还好...还好有父亲留下的保命法宝...=Fortunately...Fortunately, I have the life-saving magic weapon left by my father...
云秋兰从怀中掏出一个碎的不成样子的护身宝物，默默地凝视着。=Yun Qiulan took out a broken and shapeless protective treasure from her arms and stared at it silently.
这下...父亲留给我的东西...全都没了。=Now...all the things my father left me...are gone.
正阳山呼啸的风不知什么时候止了，残阳如血，照在云秋兰满面的阴霾上，你一时竟看不清她的神情。\r\n=The howling wind in Zhengyang Mountain stopped at some point, and the setting sun was like blood, shining on Yun Qiulan's gloomy face, and you couldn't see her expression clearly for a moment. \r\n
云秋兰突然抬起头来，抬眼向你看去，看似平静的目光里，你看到了疲惫、虚弱、哀伤，如一团乱麻，斩不断，理还乱。=Yun Qiulan suddenly raised her head and looked up at you. In her seemingly calm eyes, you saw exhaustion, weakness, and sadness, like a mess that kept being chopped off and still in chaos.
谢谢你，放我下来吧。=Thank you, please let me down.
云秋兰稳稳地站在了地上，澹台仙迅速赶来，轻轻一挥，掸去了你们身上的尘土。=Yun Qiulan stood firmly on the ground, and Tantai Immortal rushed over quickly, brushing off the dust on your bodies with a gentle wave.
多谢相助。=Thanks for the help.
对了...上次在广场上，也多谢你。=By the way...Thank you also for last time in the square.
云秋兰言罢，神情黯淡，转身欲走。=After Yun Qiulan finished speaking, her expression turned gloomy and she turned to leave.
突然想起了什么，蓦地看向你的眼睛，似乎在观察你。=Suddenly I remembered something and looked into your eyes, seeming to be observing you.
此战了后，我想和澹台师姐一起去调查一下我父亲的事情...=After this battle, I want to investigate my father's affairs with Senior Sister Tantai...
如果你愿意来的话，我想我需要你的帮助。=If you'd like to come, I think I could use your help.
...我可以信任你吗？=...can I trust you?
云秋兰神色不变，眼中神采似乎亮了三分。=Yun Qiulan's expression remained unchanged, and the look in her eyes seemed to brighten.
那太好了，到时候不见不散......=That's great, see you there then...
我们在云汐城客栈会面，届时一起前往。=We will meet at Yunxi City Inn and go there together.
云秋兰说罢，面色如水，没有片刻停留，向着战场飞遁而去。=After Yun Qiulan said that, her face was like water, and she flew away towards the battlefield without stopping for a moment.
在杀阵和长老们的围攻下，一切很快就结束了。=Under the siege of the killing array and the elders, everything was over quickly.
你看到远处，恒如似乎在和秋兰说些什么，秋兰一语不发，只是时不时地望向你和澹台仙的方向，还有那远处的残阳。=You see in the distance, Hengru seems to be saying something to Qiulan. Qiulan doesn't say a word, but looks in the direction of you and Tantai Xian from time to time, as well as the setting sun in the distance.
残阳下，化尘教的弟子们三三两两地打扫着战场。正阳山又恢复了往日的平静。=Under the setting sun, disciples of Huachen Sect were cleaning the battlefield in twos and threes. Zhengyang Mountain has returned to its former peace.
澹台仙向弟子下完令后，向你飞来，微微一笑。=After Tantai Immortal finished giving orders to his disciples, he flew towards you and smiled slightly.
此次多谢前来襄助，这是此战的报酬，还请收下。=Thank you very much for coming to help us this time. This is the reward for this battle. Please accept it.
好，我还要负责指挥清整后山，就不奉陪了。没别的事的话，我们下次再会。=Okay, I still have to be responsible for commanding the clearing up of the back mountains, so I won’t accompany you. If there's nothing else, we'll see you next time.
你并未多言，径直向妖兽冲去。=You didn't say much and rushed straight towards the monster.
让我来！快去看看秋兰怎么样了！=let me! Go and see how Qiulan is doing!
你被一道引力倏地弹开，听闻此言，立刻掉转方向，直直向秋兰飞去。=You were suddenly bounced away by a gravitational force. After hearing this, you immediately turned around and flew straight towards Qiulan.
云府秘闻=Secrets of Yun Mansion
前往云汐城客栈协助云秋兰。=Go to Yunxi City Inn to assist Yun Qiulan.
云秋兰即将前往云府探寻过往之事，去云汐城客栈与其会面。=Yun Qiulan is about to go to Yun Mansion to explore the past and meet with her at Yunxi City Inn.
客栈里十分安静，有些冷清，你一眼便看见了前来迎接你的澹台仙。=The inn was very quiet and deserted, and you immediately saw Tantai Xian who came to greet you.
你来啦~快进来吧~=You are here~ Come in~
澹台仙热情地将你请入厢房，朝你做了个噤声的手势，指了指伏案打盹小憩的云秋兰。=Tantai Xian warmly invited you into the side room, made a silent gesture towards you, and pointed at Yun Qiulan, who was taking a nap at the desk.
她怎么了？=What's up with her?
秋兰她太累了。=Qiulan is too tired.
唉，秋兰只要一有空闲，就在钻研过去的这些事情，想要证明父亲的清白。自从晋升长老之后，能够调阅过去的档案，更是日夜不休。=Alas, Qiulan would delve into these past events whenever she had free time, trying to prove her father's innocence. Since being promoted to elder, he has been able to access past files day and night.
你在桌旁坐下，云秋兰静静地趴着，轻柔地呼吸着，像个温顺的小猫。=You sat down at the table, and Yun Qiulan lay quietly, breathing softly, like a docile kitten.
桌上则摆满了各式各样的玉简，但被很整齐地分为四堆，摆在秋兰面前。=The table was filled with various jade slips, but they were neatly divided into four piles and placed in front of Qiulan.
这可是个耗神的事情，让她先养养神吧。=This is a tiring matter, so let her rest her mind first.
你有兴趣也可以先看看，等秋兰醒了我们便出发。=If you are interested, you can take a look first, and we will set off when Qiulan wakes up.
不读了=Don't read anymore
略新的书简=Slightly new letter
较旧的书简=Older Letters
古朴的书简=Simple letter
古老的书简=Ancient letters
<color\=#FF0000>云府秘闻</color>任务已开启=<color\=#FF0000>Secrets of Yun Mansion</color>The mission has been started
远远观瞧，平常广场接取任务的地方，围了不少的人。=Looking from afar, there were quite a few people surrounding the square where tasks were usually received.
奇了怪了，今天怎么这么热闹。=It's strange, why is it so lively today.
定睛一看，只见人群中有一年少女子，正被数名同门恶语相向。=Taking a closer look, he saw a young girl in the crowd who was being shouted at by several of her classmates.
此女不过十几岁的样子，像是刚入宗不久的修士，看起来很是年轻。=This woman was only in her teens, like a monk who had just joined the sect, and she looked very young.
她忍耐着，在周围同门的指摘与排挤声中，轻咬朱唇，一语不发。=She endured it, biting her red lips and saying nothing amidst the criticism and rejection from her peers around her.
我...我......=me......
而她面前那位外门执事更是显得十分尴尬，面对着激动的人群，一时有些手足无措。=The outer deacon in front of her looked even more embarrassed. Facing the excited crowd, he was at a loss for a moment.
那女娃看着资质倒是不错，真不知是做了什么，竟被同门如此对待。=That girl seemed to have good qualifications, but I really don't know what she did to be treated like this by her fellow students.
魏无级捋了捋胡子，意味深长地轻叹了一声。=Wei Wuwei stroked his beard and sighed meaningfully.
小子，你打算怎么做？=Boy, what are you going to do?
了解情况=understand situation
还不知道发生了什么，咱们先了解一下情况吧。=We still don’t know what happened, so let’s first understand the situation.
这位道友，不知这是发生什么事了？那位姑娘是...？=Fellow Taoist, I wonder what happened? Is that girl...?
你不知道啊，我和你讲，她就是云秋兰！=You don’t know, let me tell you, she is Yun Qiulan!
这位修士有些激动，眨巴着眼镜看着你，似乎在等待你的反应，你有些莫名其妙。=The monk was a little excited and looked at you with his glasses blinking, as if waiting for your reaction. You were a little confused.
这...云秋兰怎么了？=What's wrong with Yun Qiulan?
云秋兰啊！云家你都不知道？我明白了，你定是这几年刚入门的弟子吧，=Yun Qiulan! You don’t even know about the Yun family? I understand. You must be a new disciple in the past few years.
之前化尘教封山之事，你总知道吧。当年为了好让掌门安心闭关，特地封山肃反戡乱，揪出古神教的奸细。=You must have known about the Huachen Sect’s closure of the mountain before. At that time, in order to allow the leader to retreat with peace of mind, he specially sealed the mountain to suppress the rebellion and uncovered the spies of the Ancient God Sect.
而这云家夫妻啊，就是古神教安插在化尘教最大的奸细，干过的坏事啊，那是罄竹难书，后来据说畏罪潜逃，生死不明。=And this couple from the Yun family were the biggest spies planted by the Ancient God Sect in the Huachen Sect. The bad things they had done were too numerous to describe. It was later said that they fled in fear of crime and their lives and deaths were unknown.
真是想不到啊，云家夫妻可是以前化尘教的中流砥柱，大家都很信任他们......竟然害死那么多同门。=It is really unexpected that the Yun family and his wife were the mainstays of the Huachen Sect in the past. Everyone trusted them... but they actually killed so many of their fellow disciples.
唉，之后的事情，就谁也不知道了，但真没想到居然还有个孩子留在宗内。=Alas, no one knows what happened after that, but I never expected that there would be a child left in the sect.
要我说啊，与其把这云秋兰逐出宗门，不如让云秋兰给她父母赎罪...=Let me tell you, instead of expelling Yun Qiulan from the sect, it would be better to let Yun Qiulan atone for her parents' sins...
大家冷静一下，冷静一下......=Everyone, calm down, calm down...
谈论之间，围观的人越来越多，外门执事试图维持秩序，可是现场却越来越乱。=During the discussion, more and more people were watching. The outside deacon tried to maintain order, but the scene became increasingly chaotic.
有的交头接耳着，有的则在冷静地旁观。而很明显的是，有几个家伙嗓门最大。=Some were whispering to each other, while others were watching calmly. And obviously, there are a few guys who have the loudest voices.
声音粗犷的同门=A fellow student with a rough voice
同门们！她就是云秋兰！是那两个大叛徒的后人！=Fellow disciples! She is Yun Qiulan! They are the descendants of those two great traitors!
声音尖细的同门=The classmate with a shrill voice
是啊！她改名换姓易容混进我们执行任务的队伍里，谁知道她打算干什么！=yes! She changed her name and disguised herself to sneak into our mission team. Who knows what she plans to do!
声音沙哑的同门=A fellow student with a hoarse voice
把她逐出化尘教！=Expel her from the Huachen Sect!
有点意思，看来这事是有人安排的。喏，看那边，那几个嗓门大的，把煽动情绪四个字都快写脸上了。=It's interesting, it seems like this was arranged by someone. Well, look over there, those loud voices have the word "incitement" written all over their faces.
而另一边，只见云秋兰的脸色越来越糟糕，浑身颤抖着，犹如风中梨花轻颤，似乎随时会滴下雨来。=On the other side, Yun Qiulan's face was getting worse and worse, her whole body was trembling, like pear blossoms trembling in the wind, and it seemed like rain would fall at any time.
叛徒之后...可惜了，这姑娘看起来倒不像恶人。小子，咱们现在怎么办？=After the traitor... It's a pity that this girl doesn't look like a villain. Boy, what do we do now?
挺身相助=Come to help
你大概明白了发生了什么。=You probably understand what's going on.
诸位同门！宗门广场，清净之地，不可大声喧哗，大家都冷静一下！=Fellow disciples! Zongmen Square is a pure place. Don’t make loud noises. Everyone, please calm down!
你是哪根葱？=Which onion are you?
是啊，你知道这姑娘是谁吗你就为她出头？=Yes, do you know who this girl is and you stand up for her?
她可是云秋兰！云家的后人！你知道吗！当年她父母害死了多少我们的人？=She is Yun Qiulan! Descendants of the Yun family! do you know! How many of our people did her parents kill back then?
这回她改名换姓易容想要混入我们当中，谁知道她是不是古神教的奸细？=This time she changed her name and disguised herself in an attempt to blend in among us. Who knows if she is a spy of the Ancient God Religion?
你不知道原委就少管闲事！我认得你！你是封山后才入宗门的修士吧！=If you don’t know the whole story, just mind your own business! I recognize you! Are you a monk who entered the sect after the mountain was closed?
她父母可是当年化尘教最大的奸细！叛徒！现在还在逍遥法外！=Her parents were the biggest spies of the Huachen Sect back then! traitor! Still on the loose now!
我看你和她就是一伙的！=I think you and her are in the same group!
一群人七嘴八舌差点给你整晕了，一时百口莫辩。=A group of people are talking so much that it almost makes you faint, and you can't argue for a while.
保持克制=exercise restraint
怒极出手=Take action in anger
眼看他们越说越过分，你体内气血逐渐翻涌，你知道这里是什么地方，你保持着冷静和克制。=Seeing that they are getting more and more exaggerated, the blood in your body gradually surges. You know where this place is, and you remain calm and restrained.
别，别冲动...为了我，不值得......=Don't, don't be impulsive...For me, it's not worth it...
纤纤玉手拉住了你，你回头一看，正好对上云秋兰澄澈的双眸。=A slender hand held yours, and when you looked back, you met Yun Qiulan's clear eyes.
她的眼神里没有了先前的慌乱，取而代之的是释然与平静，如碧波般澄净明亮，有人愿意挺身而出显然鼓舞了她。=Her eyes no longer had the previous panic, but were replaced by relief and calm, as clear and bright as blue waves. Someone who was willing to come forward obviously inspired her.
就在这时，耳边一声娇喝传来，不怒自威，令在场众人浑身一颤。=At this moment, a sweet shout came from his ears, which made everyone present tremble.
肃静！宗门清净之地，岂能容尔等肆意喧哗！？=quiet! How can the sect's pure land tolerate your wanton noise! ?
只见一道遁光闪过，沙尘飞舞，澹台仙负手站在广场高台之上，再看那几个带头煽动之人，竟已被捆得严严实实。=I saw a flash of light and dust flying. Tantai Immortal stood on the high platform of the square with his hands behind his hands. Looking at the instigators, they were already tightly tied up.
尔等不思清修，反倒煽动同门、寻衅滋事，去弟子房禁闭思过！罚抄教义万遍！=Instead of thinking about pure cultivation, you instigated fellow disciples, provoked quarrels and troubles, and went to the disciples' room to confine yourself to think about your mistakes! He was punished for copying the teachings thousands of times!
你...你这人怎么是非不分！还...还出手攻击同门...=You...you don't know the difference between right and wrong! And... he even attacked his fellow disciples...
这人似乎还想挣扎什么，抬头看清出手的人之后，立马老实了。=This man seemed to want to struggle for something. After he raised his head and saw the person who made the move, he immediately became honest.
是，是澹台前辈...我们知错了...=Yes, it's Senior Tantai... We know we were wrong...
哦？你们倒是识相，说吧，为何在此唯恐天下不乱？=oh? You guys know each other, tell me, why are you here so that the world will not be in chaos?
呵，我没记错的话，你们几个早就劣迹斑斑。屡教不改，可是要逐出宗门的。不过我可以做主，在大家面前，给你们一个坦白的机会。=Ha, if I remember correctly, you guys have already been doing bad things. Those who refuse to change despite repeated admonitions will be expelled from the sect. But I can make the decision and give you a chance to confess in front of everyone.
几人面面相觑，似乎还想辩解些什么，只见澹台仙手指轻捻，几人身上的束缚便立刻紧上数倍，疼的他们龇牙咧嘴。=Several people looked at each other, as if they wanted to defend themselves, but they saw Tantai Xian gently twisting his fingers, and the restraints on several people immediately tightened several times, and they grimaced in pain.
过期不候。=No waiting until expiration date.
我说我说！是有人雇我们在这里起哄...=I said, I said! Someone hired us to heckle us here...
同门们，大家都听到了吧，莫要被有心之人煽动。=Fellow disciples, you must have heard it, don’t be incited by people with bad intentions.
云秋兰当年未被逐出宗门，自是缘由的。而改名易容，也是长老们的命令，希望她能够低调地参加任务而已。=This was the reason why Yun Qiulan was not expelled from the sect back then. The change of name and disguise was also an order of the elders, hoping that she could participate in the mission in a low-key manner.
我不服！云秋兰明明是叛徒之后，却能安然无恙地生活在化尘教，甚至有机会直接进入内门，凭什么！难道就是因为资质好吗？他父母的事情就这么放过她了吗？=I'm not convinced! After Yun Qiulan was clearly a traitor, she was able to live in the Huachen Sect safely and unscathed, and even had the opportunity to directly enter the inner sect. Why! Is it just because of good qualifications? Did she just let her go about his parents?
澹台仙冷冷地扫了那几个作乱之人一眼，随后向在场的众人施了一礼，娓娓说道。=Tantai Xian glanced coldly at the troublemakers, then saluted everyone present and spoke softly.
各位同门，云秋兰虽是罪人之后，但其父母受指控之时，她不过还在襁褓之中。=Fellow disciples, although Yun Qiulan is a criminal queen, she was still an infant when her parents were accused.
当年我等为其求情，使云师妹免于逐出化尘教，便是为了正法纪、明教义。冤有头，债有主。=When we interceded for him and saved Junior Sister Yun from being expelled from the Huachen Sect, it was for the sake of rectifying the law and clarifying the teachings. Every injustice has its owner, and every debt has its owner.
云家二人目前下落不明，此案疑点颇多，究竟是诬陷还是事实我们都无从考证。即使是事实，他们的罪过也该由自己承担，与云师妹这个孩子无关。=The whereabouts of the two Yun family members are currently unknown. There are many doubts about this case. We have no way of verifying whether it is a frame-up or a fact. Even if it is true, their sins should be borne by themselves and have nothing to do with the child Junior Sister Yun.
再加上秋兰资质如此难得，我教长老不愿暴殄天物，好好培养，能为我教做出更大的贡献。=In addition, Qiulan's qualifications are so rare. The elders of our sect are not willing to waste their natural resources. If they train her well, they can make greater contributions to our sect.
入得我教，即脱凡尘，皆为姐妹兄弟，当有好生之德。更何况云师妹成长于化尘教中，与你我同衣同食。虽然时常隐姓埋名，但她是什么样的人，在场的各位师弟师妹，肯定有人了解。=Once you gain my teaching, you will be freed from the mundane world. We will all become sisters and brothers, and you should have the virtue of living a good life. What's more, Junior Sister Yun grew up in the Huachen Sect, sharing the same clothes and food with you and me. Although she often keeps her name anonymous, all the junior brothers and sisters present must know what kind of person she is.
我澹台仙愿意以自身名誉为担保，希望大家能给她一个证明自己的机会。=I, Tantai Xian, am willing to use my reputation as a guarantee and hope that everyone can give her a chance to prove herself.
这...既然澹台师姐都这么说了，我等自不会纠缠。=This... Since Senior Sister Tantai has said so, I won't get entangled in it.
没想到平素温婉和善的澹台前辈，发起怒来竟是如此模样...大家面面相觑，很快便纷纷表态。=didn't expect that senior Tantai, who was usually gentle and kind, would look like this when he got angry... Everyone looked at each other in shock, and soon expressed their opinions one after another.
那位窘迫的外门执事擦了擦冷汗，赶忙向澹台仙深施一礼。=The embarrassed outer deacon wiped his cold sweat and hurriedly bowed to Tantai Immortal.
多谢澹台前辈解围，在下这就把此次任务的玉简发放给诸位同门。=Thank you to Senior Tantai for rescuing the siege. I will distribute the jade slips for this mission to all my fellow disciples.
澹台仙脸色缓和了不少，点了点头。=Tantai Xian's expression softened a lot and he nodded.
无论大家相不相信我，我云秋兰都会用行动去证明，我是一个顶天立地、光明正大的人！从今日起，我不会再易容改名，我就是我！我就是云秋兰！=Regardless of whether you believe me or not, I, Yun Qiulan, will use my actions to prove that I am an upright and upright person! From today on, I will not change my name or disguise myself, I am who I am! I am Yun Qiulan!
我父母的事情，我一定会查清！如果他们是真的有罪，我绝不会逃避，我云秋兰自会亲自解决一切！=I will definitely find out what happened to my parents! If they are really guilty, I will never escape. I, Yun Qiulan, will solve everything myself!
只见云秋兰憋红了脸，鼓足勇气，将几句承诺朗声撂下，随即从执事手中夺走参加任务的玉简，感激地看了你一眼，头也不回地走了。=Yun Qiulan suppressed her blush, mustered up her courage, said a few words of promise aloud, and then took the jade slip participating in the mission from the deacon's hand, glanced at you gratefully, and left without looking back.
小友，做的不错。=Well done, kid.
澹台仙赞许地向你点了点头，指了指手中的传音符，向你笑了笑。你低头一看，不知何时自己的传音符上已经留下了澹台仙和云秋兰的印记，再一抬头，澹台仙已经消失不见了。=Tantai Xian nodded to you approvingly, pointed to the transmission talisman in his hand, and smiled at you. You looked down and saw that the marks of Tantai Xian and Yun Qiulan had been left on your transmission notes at some point. When you looked up again, Tantai Xian had disappeared.
一声巨响从不远处的炼器房中传来，把刚走进神兵阁的你吓了一跳。=A loud noise came from the weapon refining room not far away, startling you when you just entered the Shenbing Pavilion.
不远处正在打瞌睡的执事慌不迭地放出了护体法器，睡意全无，随即着急忙慌地带着几个炼器弟子前去施法救火。=The deacon who was dozing not far away hurriedly released the body-protecting magic weapon. He was completely sleepless, and then hurriedly led several weapon-refining disciples to cast spells to put out the fire.
滚滚浓烟当中，一个高挑美丽的身影缓步走出，竟是大师姐澹台仙。=Amidst the billowing smoke, a tall and beautiful figure slowly walked out. It was the senior sister Tantai Xian.
她身上蒙着一层土灰，虽然显得有些狼狈，但神色依旧从容，似乎在沉思着什么。=She was covered with a layer of dust. Although she looked a little embarrassed, her expression was still calm, as if she was deep in thought.
回过神来回头看了看已经惨不忍睹的炼器室，澹台仙表情有些尴尬，似乎很不好意思，挠了挠头。=After coming back to his senses, he looked back at the already miserable weapon refining room. Tantai Xian looked a little embarrassed, as if he was embarrassed, and scratched his head.
这，这实在不好意思，有劳各位善后了，炼器房的损失，在下会全部赔偿的...=This, I'm really sorry. I'd like to thank you all for sorting out the aftermath. I will fully compensate for the damage to the refining room...
炼器执事哭笑不得，显得很是无奈，不过澹台仙毕竟是首席弟子，在众弟子中名声极佳，素有威信，倒也没追究什么。=The weapon-refining deacon couldn't laugh or cry, and seemed very helpless. However, after all, Tantai Immortal was the chief disciple. He had an excellent reputation and prestige among the disciples, so he didn't pursue anything.
我的姑奶奶欸，这...这是您最近炸的第四个炼器室了吧...=My aunt, this...is this the fourth weapon refining room you've blown up recently...
罢了，澹台师姐啊，炸了炼器室事小，伤及自身事大，您这得多加小心才行啊。=Forget it, Senior Sister Tantai, blowing up the weapon refining room is a small matter, but hurting yourself is a big deal, so you have to be more careful.
唉，您说的我都明白。可是师父给我的这古籍中的炼器之法甚是诡异，每次稍有不慎便会灵力失控，依书上说，需要一些增强神念的材料作为辅助。=Alas, I understand everything you said. However, the method of refining weapons in the ancient book that Master gave me is very strange. Every time I am not careful, my spiritual power will be out of control. According to the book, I need some materials to enhance my spiritual thoughts as assistance.
现在看来，普通的凝神玉还是不够，若有五个凝神玉髓，想必定能解决炼器中存在的问题，不知宗门可还有库存？=Now it seems that ordinary Condensing Jade is still not enough. If there are five Concentrating Chalcedony, I think it will definitely solve the problems in the refining. I wonder if the sect still has stock?
这...材料库里暂时倒是没有，不过我记得应该是出产自风雷谷吧，这样吧，我正好要去广场发布采买任务，这条给您加上。=This... I don't have it in the material library for the time being, but I remember that it should be produced in Fenglei Valley. Well, I happen to be going to the square to issue a purchasing task, so I will add this for you.
多谢道友费心了，不过我这个需求不想公之于众，不知能不能您直接指派手下弟子前去采买？放心，这个报酬肯定是只多不少的。=Thank you fellow Taoist for taking the trouble, but I don’t want to make this demand public. I wonder if you can directly assign your disciples to go purchase it? Don't worry, the reward will definitely be a lot more.
最近宗门有一批大的炼器任务，所有神兵阁弟子都在加班加点赶工，怕是力不从心啊。这......=Recently, the sect has a large number of weapon refining tasks, and all the disciples of the Shenbing Pavilion are working overtime, fearing that they may not be able to do what they want. this......
执事倒是一时犯了难。此时，铁剑里的魏老突然向你传音道。=The deacon was in trouble for a moment. At this time, Mr. Wei in the Iron Sword suddenly transmitted a message to you.
这炼器之法听描述倒是怪得很，居然需要使用增强神念的材料辅助，听着好像有点印象...说不定是个机缘，小子，要不帮帮她？=This weapon refining method sounds very strange from the description. It actually requires the use of materials that enhance spiritual consciousness. It sounds a bit impressive... Maybe it's a chance. Boy, why don't you help her?
怎么，道友有兴趣帮忙？=What, fellow Taoist are you interested in helping?
澹台仙向你温婉一笑，和善地看着你，等待着你的答复。=Tantai Xian smiled gently at you, looked at you kindly, and waited for your answer.
委婉拒绝=politely refuse
那就先谢过道友了，只需要五块凝神玉髓就可以了。去风雷谷采集或者去百宝行购买都是可以的。=Then thank you fellow Taoist in advance, you only need five pieces of Concentrating Chalcedony. You can go to Fenglei Valley to collect it or go to Baobao Store to buy it.
这是用于采买的灵石，还请拿好。到时候直接让当值神兵阁执事转交给我就行。我还有要事在身，就先告辞了。=This is a spiritual stone for purchase, please keep it. When the time comes, just ask the deacon on duty at the Shenbing Pavilion to hand it over to me. I have something else to attend to, so I'll take my leave.
澹台仙向你施了一礼，又向炼器执事租了一间炼器房，马不停蹄地忙活起来。=Immortal Tantai bowed to you, rented a refining room from the refining deacon, and started working non-stop.
好嘛，这女娃钻研起来，可真是认真啊......=Well, this girl is really serious when she studies...
交付澹台仙的委托=A commission to deliver to Tantai Immortal
你把一袋凝神玉髓交给了神兵阁执事。=You handed a bag of Concentrating Chalcedony to the deacon of Shenbing Pavilion.
辛苦道友了，我这就去通禀澹台道友。=Thank you for your hard work, fellow Taoist, I will go and report to fellow Taoist Tantai.
很快，澹台仙便匆匆向你走来，笑颜如花。=Soon, Tantai Xian hurried towards you, smiling like a flower.
多谢道友了，这是给您的报酬，还请不要客气。=Thank you, fellow Taoist, this is your reward, please don't be polite.
对了，澹台道友，不知您这炼器之法是何来头？=By the way, fellow Taoist Tantai, I wonder where your weapon-refining method comes from?
澹台仙向你不好意思地笑了笑，似乎思索了一下，向你说道。=Tantai Xian smiled sheepishly at you, seemed to think about it for a moment, and said to you.
此法内容虽是机密，但其实来头倒不是什么秘密。这是我派掌门晟慧真君闭关前留给云氏夫妻的秘本。在云氏夫妻下落不明之后，便落到其他三大长老手中。=Although the content of this method is confidential, its origin is not actually a secret. This is the secret book that the leader of our sect, Sheng Hui Zhenjun, left to Mr. and Mrs. Yun before going into seclusion. After the Yun couple's whereabouts became unknown, they fell into the hands of the other three elders.
秘本中有掌门晟慧真君手谕，研究此术对我教至关重要。必须尽快培养出能够掌握的人。然而此术习练条件颇为苛刻，我也只是勉强摸到门槛而已。=The secret book contains the handwriting of the master Shenghui Zhenjun. Studying this technique is very important to our religion. People who can master it must be trained as soon as possible. However, the conditions for practicing this technique are quite harsh, and I just barely touched the threshold.
我素来对炼器兴趣颇深，又恰好符合此法门的学习要求，便奉命对秘本进行研究。不过没想到此法门竟如此危险，希望凝神玉髓能够管用。=have always been very interested in weapon refining, and I happened to meet the learning requirements of this method, so I was ordered to study the secret book. However, I didn't expect this method to be so dangerous, and I hope that the Concentrating Chalcedony can be effective.
不管怎样，都得先试一试才行，那我就先告辞了，多谢道友！=No matter what, I have to give it a try first, so I’ll take my leave now. Thank you fellow Taoist!
我想起来了，古籍中记载过，有一种古化尘炼器秘术，有神妙效果，但极其不稳定，对资质和神识要求极高，神念不足者需借凝神之物才能实施，但似乎早已失传...有点意思，没想到如今又出现在了化尘教手中。=I remembered that it was recorded in ancient books that there is an ancient secret technique of turning dust into weapons and refining it. It has magical effects, but it is extremely unstable and requires extremely high qualifications and spiritual consciousness. Those who lack spiritual consciousness need to use something that focuses their mind to perform it. But it seems to have been lost long ago... It's interesting, but I didn't expect it to appear in the hands of Huachen Cult now.
所以说，到底有什么神妙效果？=So, what is the magical effect?
嘿嘿，失传的秘术，我哪里知道。我要是知道的话，就不会只说是神妙效果了。不过可以肯定的是，一定是有用的东西。不然怎么会建议你掺和这事呢。=Hehe, how do I know about the lost secret technique? If I had known better, I wouldn't have just said it was a miraculous effect. But what is certain is that it must be something useful. Otherwise, why would I suggest you get involved in this matter?
等等，有印象了，好像是用于炼制...炼制....一种很重要的东西，欸，什么来着......=Wait, I have an impression, it seems to be used for refining... refining... a very important thing, eh, what is it...
看着陷入沉思的魏老，你一时有些无语。=Looking at Mr. Wei who was deep in thought, you were speechless for a moment.
算了算了，以后有机缘自然就知道了，魏老您好好歇着吧。=Forget it, I'll find out when I have the opportunity in the future. Mr. Wei, just have a good rest.
魏老尴尬地笑了笑，似乎还在思索。和魏老同行这么久，你早已习惯，便也不再打扰他，继续做自己的事情去了。=Mr. Wei smiled awkwardly and seemed to be still thinking. You have long been accustomed to walking with Mr. Wei for so long, so you stopped disturbing him and continued to do your own thing.

藏经楼二层，也称为秘阁，一般是用来存放门中高阶神通功法。=The second floor of the scripture collection building, also known as the Secret Pavilion, was generally used to store the high level divine ability techniques of the sect.
与楼下不同，除更多的禁制阵法密布之外，秘阁中反而难见人影，也没那么多记载神通功法的书籍，有的只是几块玉简，各自分开存放着，显得十分庄重但也不免有些冷清。=Unlike downstairs, in addition to more forbidden formations dense, the secret cabinet, on the contrary, it is difficult to see people, but also not so many books that record the power of the gods, there are just a few pieces of jade, each separated from the storage, it seems to be very solemn but also can not help but be a little cold.
你还是第一次来秘阁，自然是打算将所有秘术都先了解一番，而后再挑出适合自己的。=It's still your first time coming to the Secret Pavilion, so naturally you intend to learn about all the secret arts first, and later pick out the ones that suit you.
魏无极显然也是对这秘阁很感兴趣，但或许因为他只是灵体，竟然无法阅读记载秘术的玉简。而你也沉浸在秘术中无暇顾及他，只能让魏无极忍受着无法满足的好奇心在秘阁中瞎逛。=Wei Wuji was obviously also interested in this Secret Pavilion, but perhaps because he was only a spirit body, he was surprisingly unable to read the jade slips that recorded the secret arts. And as you were also immersed in the secret arts with no time to care about him, you could only let Wei Wuji endure his insatiable curiosity as he wandered blindly in the Secret Pavilion.
好在秘阁平时难有修士叨扰，也未招来什么麻烦。=The good thing is that the Secret Pavilion is usually difficult for cultivators to disturb, and has not attracted any trouble.

It was only after a sudden awakening that you broke free from the illusion of the inner demon and condensed the Nascent Infant into form.

（平静地看着你）道友何事？=(Calmly looking at you) What is it, fellow cultivator?
在附近偶尔能够看到蛟龙渡劫的奇景，据说这种渡劫九死一生，只有极少数的幼年蛟龙度过雷劫后才能化为真龙。=Occasionally, one can witness the spectacular sight of flood dragons undergoing tribulations nearby. It is said that surviving such tribulations is extremely perilous, and only a very small number of juvenile flood dragons can transform into true dragons after successfully overcoming the thunder tribulation.

上古龙族与鲲族一场大战，搅得东海天翻地覆，龙宫也沉于海底，不知所踪。至今东海的种种乱象也是因当年的大战而起。=In an ancient battle between the Dragon Clan and the Kun Clan, the East Sea was turned upside down. The Dragon Palace also sank to the bottom of the sea, and its whereabouts are unknown. To this day, various disturbances in the East Sea are said to be the aftermath of that great war.
近些年来经常能看到一些新的岛屿上浮出海面，有人说它们实际是上古龙宫的残骸。=In recent years, new islands have frequently surfaced in the sea. Some say they are actually remnants of the ancient Dragon Palace.
听说有人在附近的海域找到了曾经上古龙宫留下的古代遗物，拿去蓬沙岛采筠阁换得了不少灵石呢！=It is said that someone found ancient artifacts left by the ancient Dragon Palace in the nearby sea area and exchanged them for a considerable amount of spirit stones at the Bamboo Pavilion on Penglai Island!
传闻上古龙宫之中，埋藏着许多上古龙族的异宝，其中更是包括龙族突破化神所用的异火秘术。=There are rumors that within the ancient Dragon Palace, many treasures of the ancient Dragon Clan are buried, including the esoteric techniques used by the dragon clan to break through the Nascent Soul stage.
若是能在此连胜，说不定还能成为我连家的供奉，享受各种海上修士羡慕的待遇。=If you can achieve consecutive victories here, you might even become a disciple of my Lian family, enjoying various privileges admired by sea cultivators.

浪方海域是因四大妖圣之一的浪方大圣而得名的，传说浪方本体长愈千里，不过却几乎没有人真的见过，也不知是真是假。=The Langfang Sea region is named after one of the Four Great Demon Saints, the Langfang Grand Sage. Legend has it that the true form of Langfang spans over a thousand miles, but hardly anyone has actually seen it, and its existence remains uncertain.
上古时期，鲲与鹏本是一体，名为鲲鹏，是为神兽，上天入海无所不能。后来血脉流传了千万年才化为了现在的鲲与鹏。=In ancient times, Kun and Peng were originally one entity, known as Kunpeng, a divine beast that could roam freely between the heavens and the sea. It wasn't until after bloodlines had circulated for millions of years that they transformed into the Kun and Peng we know today.
鲲族自视甚高，不屑化作人形，也从未与人交流过，所以这片海域叫什么至今没有一个定论。近千年来鲲族属“浪方”最强，所以往来修士也以这个名字命名这片海域。=The Kun Clan considers itself superior, disdaining to take on humanoid forms, and has never communicated with humans. Therefore, there is still no consensus on the name of this region. For nearly a thousand years, the Kun Clan has been the strongest in the 'Langfang' region, and so cultivators have named this sea area after them.
曾几何时，无尽之海中近半的海域都是由鲲族主宰。上古龙族与鲲族数次大战后，两败俱伤，鲲族这才退居到了这片海域。=There was a time when almost half of the endless sea was dominated by the Kun Clan. After several major battles between the ancient Dragon Clan and the Kun Clan, both sides were heavily injured. The Kun Clan then retreated to this sea area.

翻看古老的玉简，是你从未见过的形制。看起来估计有数万年的历史。上书四个大字，“化尘宝诰”。=Reviewing the ancient jade slips, you see a form you've never encountered before. It appears to have a history of tens of thousands of years. Four large characters are inscribed on it, “Cultivation Dust Treasure Edict”
“志心皈命礼。\n生于衡州，初立尘教，身怀宝玉，不落迷障。\n不愿合污，破神教入宁州，出淤泥而无所染。\n=“Devote heart, pledge life, and perform the ceremony.\nBorn in Hengzhou, initially establishing the Dust Sect, carrying a precious jade, untainted by confusion.\nUnwilling to compromise, broke away from the God Sect to Ningzhou, emerging from the mud without contamination.
与信众二百五十人俱，隐居大漠，随方设教。\n主握阴阳，圆融尘沙，万引时空，澄澈人心。\n大悲大愿，大圣大慈。太上祖师，化尘尊者。”=Together with two hundred and fifty followers, secluded in the vast desert, establishing the sect wherever fate led.\nMastering the Yin and Yang, blending dust and sand, guiding time and space, clarifying the human heart.\nGreat compassion, great vows, great sage, great kindness. Supreme Ancestor, Revered as Cultivation Dust.”
这是化尘宝诰，记载的是我们化尘教祖师的故事，我们祖师恪守正道，不愿与古神教同流合污，突破重重围堵，来到宁州大漠避世修炼。=This is the Cultivation Dust Edict, recording the story of our sect's ancestor. Our ancestor adhered to the righteous path, refusing to be tainted by the ancient God Sect. Breaking through numerous obstacles, he arrived in the desert of Ningzhou for secluded cultivation.
他最为出名的宝物便是一块宝玉，名叫<color\=#d0380a>清冥活玉</color>，此玉自有灵智，在神识方面有无上神通。=His most famous treasure was a jade named <color\=#d0380a>Clear Dark Vital Jade</color>, possessing sentience and unparalleled abilities in spiritual perception.
此玉据说无法无相，可随意变换形态位置，唯有引力可对它进行克制。为驾驭它，祖师炼制了通天灵宝浑天环，你之前看见的那个便是我依法仿制的法器，有操纵引力之能，玄妙非常。=This jade is said to be formless and can change its form and position at will, only gravity can restrain it. To control it, the ancestor crafted the Celestial Artifact, the Hùn Tiān Ring, which you've seen before—a replica created according to the law. It has the ability to manipulate gravity, extremely mysterious.
在祖师飞升之前，他创造了化尘教秘境，在其中布下重重禁制，将活玉本体保护其中，不能被任何人抢夺。同样，我们也只能借此自保，不能以此外出攻伐，算是祖师留给我教最后的底牌。=Before the ancestor ascended, he created a secret realm for the Cultivation Dust Sect, setting up numerous restrictions to protect the vital jade within, preventing anyone from seizing it. Similarly, we can only use it for self-preservation and not for external aggression, considered the final trump card left by the ancestor for our sect.
翻看古朴的玉简，这份看起来也同样十分古老，里面是一篇远古化尘掌门的书表。=Browsing through the ancient jade slips, this one looks equally ancient. It contains a document about the ancient leader of the Cultivation Dust Sect.
“敬告历代祖师，徒儿不肖，正邪大战一役，虽举教上下万众一心，艰难险胜，然仍未守住我教历代所建之基业。祖师遗宝清冥活玉为护佑宗门不惜损耗本源，如今更是灵性大损。=“Respectful message to the ancestors of all generations, the disciple is unworthy. In the battle between righteousness and evil, although the entire sect united with one heart, the foundation built by our sect for generations was still not preserved. To protect the sect, the ancestral treasure, Clear Dark Vital Jade, was sacrificed, and now its spirituality is greatly damaged.
我辈深知活玉乃承此界天道造化而生，本是无法无相，无正无邪，而如今吸收魔气过重，以致阴阳格拒，正不制邪，痛苦万分。=We deeply understand that the Vital Jade is born from the world's heavenly laws, originally formless, transcending right and wrong. But now, due to excessive absorption of demonic energy, the balance of yin and yang is disrupted, causing immense suffering.
万年之前，太上祖师化尘尊者飞升之际曾留下秘谕，若活玉受损，须立即将其封印入秘境之内，待其自行恢复。=Ten thousand years ago, Supreme Ancestor Cultivation Dust, on the occasion of his ascension, left a secret decree. If the Vital Jade is damaged, it must be immediately sealed in the secret realm and allowed to recover on its own.
我辈谨尊秘谕，不料异变突起，将活玉请回原位后，秘境内部禁制竟全部失控，须臾之间便将秘境完全封印，我教历代祖师牌位、镇派法宝、神通秘术尽皆困于其中。=We respected this decree but an unexpected event occurred. When the Vital Jade was brought back to its original position, all the restrictions inside the secret realm lost control, sealing it completely within. The tablets of the ancestors, the sect's treasures, and the mystical arts are all trapped within.
徒儿不肖，倾尽全派之力仍无法解决。唯得一法，若有化神者，燃烬全部寿元与修为、迅速注入禁制方可破阵，此法难度堪比登天，只得作罢，留予后人。=Despite our best efforts, we couldn't resolve it. The only way is if there's a cultivator capable of transcending realms, burning their entire life force and cultivation to quickly inject it into the restrictions to break the formation. This method is as difficult as ascending to the heavens, and we had to abandon it, leaving it for future generations.
今日于此，请诸位祖师见证，自本代起，解开秘境、取出遗宝、修复活玉，为后世历代掌教之秘传夙愿，今日不成明日成，明日不成后日成，代代纪纪无穷尽也...”\n=Today, in front of you all, I request the witness of the ancestors. Starting from this generation, unlock the secret realm, retrieve the ancestral treasure, and restore the Vital Jade. It is the long-cherished wish of the sect for future generations. What is not accomplished today will be achieved tomorrow, and what is not accomplished tomorrow will be achieved the day after, endlessly through the ages...”
这是万年前正邪大战时期留下的记载。清冥活玉作为我教的底牌，在灭门之际不惜牺牲自己也要保护宗门，结果身中魔气邪气过重，灵性大损。=This is a record from thousands of years ago during the righteous and evil battle. The Clear Dark Vital Jade, as the sect's last resort during a crisis, sacrificed itself to protect the sect. Unfortunately, it absorbed too much demonic energy, causing a significant loss of spirituality.
当时的化尘教众人为了救治活玉，依照祖师所留之法将活玉请回秘境，结果...你也都看到了。此事一出，让我教多年一蹶不振，直到近千年才逐渐恢复。=At that time, the disciples of the Cultivation Dust Sect followed the ancestral instructions and sealed the Vital Jade in the secret realm to let it recover. But as you've seen, when brought back, an unforeseen event occurred, trapping everything within the secret realm.
依我推测，这是秘境的自我保护禁制，亦或是以此压制魔气缠身的活玉，让它冷静下来，自行修复...谁知道呢。=Based on my speculation, this could be a self-protective restriction of the secret realm or a means to suppress the demonic energy surrounding the Vital Jade, allowing it to calm down and undergo self-repair... Who knows for sure.
没有人知道到底是怎么回事...不过秘境其实早已打开，我教掌门在其中闭关已经百余年了...可惜是我们没有资格进去，也只能推测了。=No one knows exactly what happened. However, the secret realm has already been opened; our sect leader has been in closed-door cultivation within it for over a hundred years. Unfortunately, we are not qualified to enter and can only speculate.
你翻看了这堆较旧的书简，大抵都是一些传报的公文，时间难以分辨。但从玉简来看，应该是数百年前的样式。=You peruse a pile of older documents, mostly official reports whose timelines are challenging to discern. However, judging from the jade slips, they seem to be from a few hundred years ago.
“年月日，中州游历弟子回报，传言称玄武血脉出世，诸派厮杀相争死伤无数，最终为堕山大圣所得。”=“On this date, a disciple returning from the Central Province reported rumors of the emergence of the Xuanwu bloodline. The various sects clashed, resulting in numerous casualties. Eventually, the bloodline fell into the hands of the Fallen Mountain Great Sage.”
“年月日，古神教密线急报！堕山大圣为寻得神兽血脉融合秘法，潜入古神教盗取，不慎中计受伏，为古神教所追杀！”=“On this date, urgent report from the Ancient God Sect! Fallen Mountain Great Sage infiltrated the sect to steal the secret technique of fusing with the divine beast bloodline. Unfortunately, he fell into their trap and is now being hunted by the Ancient God Sect!”
“年月日，正阳山守山长老报，近日宁州衡州边境出现巨大灵力波动，疑似空间禁术，源头不明，是否深入侦查，还望掌教指示。”=“On this date, report from the guardian elder of the Positive Yang Mountain. Recently, there were massive fluctuations of spiritual energy near the border of Ningzhou and Hengzhou, suspected to be a spatial forbidden technique. The source is unknown; should we investigate further, seeking guidance from the sect leader?”
“年月日，化尘教巡守长老报，堕山大圣重伤求援，正在化尘教外请求庇护，当如何处置，还望掌教定夺。。”=“On this date, report from the Cultivation Dust Sect patrol elder. Fallen Mountain Great Sage is heavily injured and seeking refuge. He is currently outside the Cultivation Dust Sect, requesting guidance on how to handle this situation; please advise, Sect Leader.”
“年月日，化尘教秘境上空阴气遮天，邪气蔽日，天有异象，恐有邪孽将出，我教教众人心惶惶，当如何处置，还望掌教尽早定夺。”=“On this date, the airspace above the Cultivation Dust Sect's secret realm is covered in dark clouds and evil energy, causing a strange phenomenon in the sky. There may be a demonic calamity approaching. The disciples are anxious; how should we handle this? Please make a decision, Sect Leader.”
“年月日，我教掌教真人晟慧真君自即日起入秘境闭生死关，自今日起，为护掌教周全，我辈自当奉谕封山，肃反戡乱。”=“On this date, the Cultivation Dust Sect's Sect Leader, True Immortal Sheng Hui, has entered closed-door cultivation in the secret realm. From today onwards, to ensure the safety of the sect, we will follow the order to seal the mountain and suppress any rebellion.”
这些是近百年的公文传信，这些事情发生的时候，云秋兰还不满十岁，父母也都还安好，如今都支离破碎。=These are documents from the past century, reporting various events. At that time, Yun Qiulan was not even ten years old, and her parents were still well. Now, everything has shattered.
当时堕山大圣在中州夺得玄武血脉之后，试图将其融合至自己的血脉当中，竟铤而走险，前往古神教盗取血脉融合之法。=When Fallen Mountain Great Sage acquired the Xuanwu bloodline, he tried to fuse it with his own bloodline, infiltrating the Ancient God Sect in the process. 
被古神教重伤之后，逃至我教避难，我教把它安置在秘境外围，那里材质特殊，可以屏蔽大部分的神识探查。=After being heavily injured, he sought refuge in the Cultivation Dust Sect, where he was placed on the outskirts of the secret realm, shielded from most spiritual investigations due to the unique material there.
结果...堕山大圣不知道触发了秘境的什么禁制，居然全身法力都被吸入秘境大门当中...据说等发现的时候，已经快变成肉干了。=But unexpectedly, some unknown prohibition was triggered when Fallen Mountain Great Sage was brought back to his original position, and all his spiritual energy was absorbed into the secret realm's gateway. When it was discovered, he was nearly desiccated.
困扰化尘教这么多年的秘境，居然以如此戏剧性的方式打开，当真是造化弄人...=After the Cultivation Dust Sect faced this mystery for many years, the secret realm opened in such a dramatic way. It truly shows the twists of fate...
可惜推山兽一族在此之后，元婴期以上被古神教屠杀殆尽，以致群龙无首，最终酿成先前的兽潮大祸。=Unfortunately, after this event, the Pushing Mountain Beast clan was mostly slaughtered by the Ancient God Sect, leaving the sect leaderless, ultimately leading to the previous beast tide disaster.
你翻看了这堆较新的书简，上书“云清正案卷宗”，旁边是一些当时的公文传信。=You read through a pile of newer documents, labeled “Case of Yun Qiulan”, alongside some correspondences.
“十万火急！云清正长老发狂，与恒如长老战于宗门广场，惊天动地，无人能挡，恳请诸位长老火速出关！”=“Urgent! Senior Elder Yun Qiulan has gone mad, fighting with Senior Elder Heng Ru at the sect's plaza, causing a huge commotion. No one can stop them; urgently requesting all elders to come out!”
你放下传信，仔细阅读起卷宗起来。=You put down the correspondence and start reading the case file.
云清正案卷宗·秘\r\n云清正，号清正剑仙，晟慧真君座下弟子，习剑善剑，工于炼器，乃炼器之天才。\r其妻雨净雅本乃星河剑派门下弟子，不善争斗，精于阵法，乃阵道之大师。=Case File of Yun Qiulan·Secret\r\nYun Qiulan, also known as Sword Immortal Qiulan, a disciple under True Immortal Sheng Hui, adept in swordsmanship and artifact forging, a genius in the art of refining.\rHis wife, Rain Cleansing Ya, was originally a disciple of the Star River Sword Sect, skilled in array formations, a master in the Dao of Arrays.
年月日，云清正突然发狂，出手袭击同门，损毁神兵阁，夺取浑天环，与恒如长老战于宗门广场，魔气逼人，邪气蔽体，原因不明。=On a certain date, Yun Qiulan suddenly went mad, attacking fellow disciples, destroying the Divine Armory, and taking the Hun Tian Ring. He battled Senior Elder Heng Ru at the sect's plaza, emanating demonic and evil energies, for reasons unknown.
众目睽睽之下，举派大惊，诸长老火速出关，意欲制止，然云清正与恒如二人被未知法术传送，不知所踪。=In plain view, causing a great shock to the entire sect, the elders hurriedly came out, intending to stop them. However, Yun Qiulan and Heng Ru were mysteriously transported away by an unknown technique, and their whereabouts remain unknown.
晟慧真人闭生死关，传信无人回复，故由冶庚上人传令，组织人手对二人进行搜救，并着手调查云清正发狂一事。=True Immortal Sheng Hui is in closed-door cultivation, and no responses were received to the messages, so Elder Ye Geng took the initiative to organize a search for the two and began investigating the reason behind Yun Qiulan's madness.
后恒如真人为搜查队所救，身负重伤。据其解释，云清正是突然发狂，并非有意伤人，他受重伤之事，还望不要追究。=Later, Senior Elder Heng Ru was rescued by the search party, severely injured. According to his explanation, Yun Qiulan suddenly went mad and did not intentionally harm anyone. He urged not to pursue the matter further.
然而，随着调查的深入，我们发现之前诸项古神教大案的线索竟都指向云清正，先前肃反戡乱之事，皆由云清正负责，有监守自盗之嫌。=However, as the investigation deepened, we discovered that Yun Qiulan was the internal collaborator for several major Ancient God Sect cases. He was responsible for the previous suppression and anti-rebellion incidents, creating suspicion of betrayal.
此事一出，举派哗然，为决断此事，教内争论不休，一派认为云清正为人平素正直良善，早已是公认的继任掌教，此事过于离奇，必有蹊跷。=This revelation caused an uproar in the sect, sparking intense debates. One faction believed Yun Qiulan to be inherently upright and kind, widely recognized as the future sect leader. The bizarre nature of the case made it too suspicious to be straightforward.
另一派则多为先前案件的亲历者及其亲朋，大多或伤或死，积怨已久，群情激奋，故坚持严惩，以儆效尤。两派争论不休。=The other faction mainly consisted of those who had personally experienced the earlier cases, with many injured or deceased. Holding deep-seated grievances, they insisted on severe punishment as a deterrent. The debates continued endlessly.
然而就在两派争论不休之时，我教调查之事大有进展，逮捕大批古神教内线，缴获大量档案公文。=However, as the sect's investigation progressed, large numbers of Ancient God Sect infiltrators were arrested, and numerous documents were seized. Through interrogation and soul-searching, it was confirmed that Yun Qiulan was a spy for the Ancient God Sect, with crimes too numerous to detail.
经过审讯与搜魂，确认云清正乃是古神教内应，罪行罄竹难书，所作所为令人发指。=After interrogation and soul-searching, it was confirmed that Yun Qiulan was an infiltrator within the Ancient God Sect, and his crimes were too numerous to detail, making his actions reprehensible.
先前发狂之事，据推测，极有可能是使用魔神蛊而致走火入魔。至此此案结案。=Regarding his sudden madness, it was speculated that he may have used a demonic insect, causing him to lose control. With this, the case was closed.
最终判决如下，云清正者，谋反大逆，勾通邪派，抢夺至宝，残害同门，天地共诛，绝罚除籍，永世追剿。=The final judgment is as follows: Yun Qiulan, guilty of treason and collusion with the evil sect, seizing precious treasures, and harming fellow disciples. To be condemned by heaven and earth, expelled from the sect, and pursued for eternal punishment.
其女云秋兰本应逐出宗门，然恒如真人、澹台仙一众为其求情，念在其资质极佳，天赋异禀，暂留宗内，戴罪立功。=His daughter, Yun Qiulan, was originally to be expelled from the sect, but due to the plea from Senior Elder Heng Ru and Elder Dantai Xian, considering her outstanding talent and exceptional aptitude, she is allowed to remain temporarily within the sect with the stain of her father's crimes.
署名：代掌教务大长老冶庚上人=Signed: Elder Ye Geng, Acting Sect Leader
这些...就没有什么好说的了...唉...=There's nothing more to say about these... sigh...
如果你熟悉云清正雨净雅他们，你就知道他们绝对不可能做出那种事...但证据太齐全了...齐全到不容置疑，齐全到令人奇怪...=If you're familiar with Yun Qiulan and Rain Cleansing Ya, you'd know they could never do such things... but the evidence is overwhelming, leaving no room for doubt, making it all the more perplexing...
众口铄金，积毁销骨...为给出一个交代，最终只能速速结案，明明其实还有很多疑点的...=The truth is clouded in mystery... For the sake of an explanation, the case was hurriedly closed, even though many doubts remained...
唉...可怜了云秋兰...=Alas... poor Yun Qiulan...
在我和恒如把她保下后，她一直由我来照顾，恒如长老比较忙，但是还是会尽心尽力，他说云清正先前救过他的命，亏欠太多...=After we saved her with Heng Ru, she has been under my care. Heng Ru is quite busy, but he still does his best. He said Yun Qiulan saved his life before, and he owes her too much...
可惜秋兰太倔，她觉得所得不正的东西，便不会要。恒如做的很多事情不太干净，所以即使是筑基丹、聚顶丹这种稀缺的宝物，秋兰都不接受。不过我知道，她也都看在眼里。=Unfortunately, Qiulan is too stubborn. She refuses anything gained through illegitimate means. Even though Heng Ru does many things that are not entirely clean, she won't accept precious treasures like Foundation Building Pills or Peak Ascension Pills. But I know she sees everything.
好在秋兰资质绝佳，一路上虽然坎坷，但也得证金丹大道，如今更是可以独当一面了。=Fortunately, Qiulan's talent is outstanding. Although her path has been bumpy, she has reached the Golden Core stage and can now stand on her own.
等秋兰醒=Wait until Qiulan wakes up...
叫醒秋兰=Wake up Qiulan

据传在祖师建立竹山宗之前，这片山脉被毒气围绕，莫说普通凡人，连寻常修士也难以进入。祖师决定在此开宗立派后，不知从何处寻来这沁云竹，种植于此。=It is rumored that before the ancestor established the Bamboo Mountain Sect, this mountain range was surrounded by poisonous gas, not to mention ordinary mortals, even ordinary cultivators are difficult to enter. After the ancestor decided to establish a sect here, I do not know where to find this Qinyun bamboo, planted here.
这沁云竹不但能吸收大部分毒气瘴气，还能一定程度上将之转换为灵气，令修士在周遭修炼时有事半功倍之功效。=This Qinyun bamboo can not only absorb most of the poisonous gas miasma, but also to a certain extent will be converted into aura, so that the cultivator in the surrounding cultivation with twice the effort.
此外，若是能以秘术将特定天材地宝炼化为营养液供其吸收，还能在潜移默化之中为资质较差的修士减少一些修炼上的阻碍，对高资质修士的好处更不用我多说了。=In addition, if you can use a secret technique to refine a specific heavenly material into a nutrient solution for absorption, you can also subtly reduce some of the obstacles to the cultivation of less qualified cultivators, and there is no need for me to say more about the benefits to highly qualified cultivators.
某种程度上，我们竹山宗在甄选弟子入门时不作要求也是于此有关。=To some extent, the fact that we in the Bamboo Mountain Sect do not have requirements in selecting disciples for initiation is also related to this.
So that's how it is.=So that's how it is.
因此宗门希望门中长老外出游历时，若是有空闲，为宗门寻些灵药，当然宗门也不会亏待诸位长老。=Therefore, the clan hopes that the elders in the door when traveling, if there is free time, for the clan to find some spiritual medicine, of course, the clan will not treat the elders.
宗门目前需要大量的鬼面花、太清玄灵草，另外还对天问花和九龙参有一定需求，Jiang 若是能寻到这些灵药上交宗门，可以换取其他宗门内有的药材或是宗门贡献。=The sect currently needs a large amount of Ghost Face Flower, Tai Qing Xuan Ling Grass, and also has a certain demand for Heavenly Question Flower and Nine Dragons Ginseng, Jiang If we can find these elixirs and turn them in to the sect, we can exchange them for medicinal herbs that are available in other sects or for sect contributions.
除此之外，还有两种不常用于炼制丹药的稀有材料，Jiang Elder若是有空帮忙寻找，宗门绝不会亏待。=In addition to this, there are also two rare materials that are not commonly used in refining pills, Jiang Elder If he is free to help look for them, the clan will never lose out.
这两种材料是？=The two materials are?
其一名为阴冥冻泉，其二名为两仪旋覆花。=One of them is called the Frozen Spring of the Underworld, and the second one is called the Two-Year Spinning Flower.
这阴冥冻泉本身倒不特殊，在宁州也有类似泉眼，但这泉水在宁州几乎不会结冰，只有在极阴三海特定之处方有冻泉。想必是为阴气所凝所以有其神异之处。=This Yin underworld frozen spring itself is not special, there are similar springs in Ningzhou, but this spring in Ningzhou almost will not freeze, only in the extreme yin three sea specific prescription frozen spring. I think it must be condensed by the Yin Qi, so it has its divine features.
而这极阴三海往返宁州路途遥远，冻泉保存又不易，所以还需要另一种灵药——两仪旋覆花。据传此花有逆转阴阳的奇效，但据我所知除用于滋养沁云竹外，没有其它利用此物异能的手段。=And this extreme Yin three sea to and from Ningzhou is a long way, frozen spring preservation is not easy, so there is also a need for another kind of spiritual medicine - two Yi cyclamen flowers. It is rumored that this flower has the miraculous effect of reversing yin and yang, but as far as I know, except for nourishing the Qin Yun Bamboo, there is no other means of utilizing the supernormal capabilities of this item.
那这两仪旋覆花又要从何寻得呢？=And where do you find these two-dimensional flowers?
嗯...按=Hmmm... Press.
的记叙，这两仪旋覆花应该是产自图南海域，不过我派关于那片海域的了解并不多，只是说非常危险，Jiang 还请以自身安全为重。=The two Yi flowers should be produced in the Tunan sea, but I don't know much about the sea, just that it is very dangerous, Jiang also please take their own safety as a priority.

还有更详细的信息么？=Any more details?
竹山宗上一次寻找阴冥冻泉和两仪旋覆花已是近千年前，说来惭愧，我当时还未入门所以能提供的信息只有这些了。=The last time the Bamboo Mountain Sect searched for the Frozen Spring of the Underworld and the Two-Element Spinning Flower was nearly a thousand years ago, and I'm ashamed to say that I hadn't even started yet, so this is all the information I can provide.
不过千流海域临近图南海，Jiang Elder若是毫无头绪不妨去千流岛打听一番。=However, the Thousand Streams sea is close to the South China Sea, so Jiang Elder might as well go to the Thousand Streams Island to ask around if he is clueless.
前往千流岛打听线索。=Travel to Chiryu Island to ask for clues.
15161511/38880000=15161511/38880000
那些灵药若是真有那么罕见，估计也只有岛主可能知道了。=If those elixirs were really that rare, it was probably only the Island Master who might know about it.
嗯，去圣地问问吧。=Well, go to the Holy Land and ask.
请问这位=Excuse me.
来我千流岛圣地有何事？=What is the purpose of coming to my sanctuary on Chiryu Island?
请问这位道友来我千流岛圣地有何事？=Excuse me.daoistWhat is the purpose of coming to my sanctuary on Chiryu Island?
你向这位连家修士说明了来意。=You explained your intentions to this Lian family cultivator.
两仪旋覆花？似乎家主有曾提起过。=The Two-way Flower? It seems that the master of the house has mentioned it before.
但家主事务繁忙，恐怕没时间亲自接见=But I'm afraid the master is too busy to meet him in person.
，若是=If
能证明自己的实力，也许有机会当面询问家主。=Being able to prove yourself might give you a chance to question the head of the family face to face.
但家主事务繁忙，恐怕没时间亲自接见道友，若是道友能证明自己的实力，也许有机会当面询问家主。=But I'm afraid the master is too busy to meet him in person.daoistIfdaoistBeing able to prove yourself might give you a chance to question the head of the family face to face.
证明实力？我该如何证明？=Prove strength? How do I prove it?
呵呵，这个简单，=Oh, this is easy.
可以去擂台试一试。=You can go to the ring and try it out.
呵呵，这个简单，道友可以去擂台试一试。=Oh, this is easy.daoistYou can go to the ring and try it out.
我既已来到此处，自是同意。=Since I have come here, I agree.
未曾战胜过此对手=I've never beaten this opponent before.
你收下功法，顺势提出两仪旋覆花一事。=You accept the Kung Fu and bring up the matter of the Two-Element Spinning Flower in passing.
两仪旋覆花？两仪...关于这奇物我确实知道一二，虽不知你要此花有何用，但...你且往图南海东北部的海岛上找找，也许能有所收获。=Amphitheater? The Flower of Two Eyes... I do know a thing or two about this strange thing, although I don't know what you want this flower for, but... If you look for it on the island in the northeast of the South China Sea, you may find something.
你谢过岛主，思及那些受到控制的无辜散修，不由对千流岛后续如何解决这些棘手的问题感到几分疑惑。=You thanked the Island Master, and thinking about the innocent loose cultivators who were under control, you couldn't help but feel a few doubts about how Thousand Streams Island would subsequently resolve these thorny issues.
前往图南海东北部的海岛上寻找两仪旋覆花。=Travel to the island in the northeastern part of the South China Sea to find the Two Element Spinning Flower.
在千流岛圣地获取两仪旋覆花信息。=Get information on the Two Globe Spinning Flower at the Thousand Streams Island Sanctuary.
前往千流岛擂台证明实力。=Go to the Thousand Streams Island ring to prove your strength.
这山上似乎有一角幻阵？似乎还是自然生成的类型。=There seems to be a corner of an illusion formation on this mountain? It still seems to be a naturally occurring type.
此处地处图南海东部，或许与两仪旋覆花有什么联系。=This is located in the eastern part of the Tuhai Sea, and may have some connection to the Two-Year Spinning Flower.
你向着阵法所在走去。=You head towards where the formation is.
沿着山体步行片刻后，半具蛇类动物骸骨出现在你身前。=After a few moments of walking along the mountain, half of a snake-like animal skeleton appears in front of you.
那是一具巨大的骨骸，即便不是蛇类，对于其他妖兽而言也称得上巨大。其颅骨大小不亚于接近成年的推山兽，与之匹配的身躯理应也长过大号的灵舟，但...=It was a huge skeleton, even if it wasn't a snake, it was still considered huge for other demonic beasts. The size of its skull was no less than that of a near-adult Mountain Pushing Beast, and its matching body should have been longer than a large Spirit Boat as well, but...
这巨蛇颅骨后连接着的只有小半截脊柱，短到从正面很难看到。脊柱断面极其平整且怪异，与其说是断面，更像是被卡在幻阵的边界上。=There was only a small half of a spine attached to the back of this giant snake's skull, so short that it was hard to see from the front. The spinal column section was extremely flat and weird, and rather than a section, it looked more like it was stuck on the boundary of an illusionary formation.
有趣，这蛇骨的位置真是微妙...或者说，它是在阵法中遭遇了不测，想要离开时支撑不住倒在幻阵边界上。嗯，很有可能。=Interesting, the location of this snake bone is really subtle... Or perhaps it had met an untimely end in the formation and couldn't support itself when it tried to leave and collapsed on the boundary of the illusion formation. Well, it's quite possible.
你谨慎地越过骸骨走向幻境，未受到任何阻拦便融入其中。=You cautiously walk over the skeleton towards the illusion and blend in without being stopped.
跨入幻阵后，原本眼前的景色留在了外边，现在你视野中只有一个洞穴。=After stepping into the illusionary formation, the original view in front of you stays outside, and now there is only a cave in your field of vision.
弯弯绕绕地走不短时间又探索了几条岔路后，你来到了洞穴的最深处。=After bending around for a short time and exploring a few more forks in the road, you come to the deepest part of the cave.
与之前的洞穴不同，这里虽然让凡人依旧难以视物，但已经有些微光芒从另一端传来。让你即便不展开神识探查，也略略能感受到前方宽阔了不少，更是能看到离洞穴的尽头已是不远。=Different from the previous cave, here although it is still difficult for mortals to see, but there has been some light from the other end. Let you even if you do not unfold the divine sense to explore, but also slightly can feel the front broadened a lot, but also can see from the end of the cave is not far away.
这些光...是什么特别的矿石么，还是...那朵花？=These lights... Is it any particular ore, or... The flower?
不论是=regardless of whether...
还是千流岛岛主给你关于两仪旋覆花的消息都不是很多，更是不会涉及到这花是否会发出光芒。=Still, the Thousand Streams Island Island Master didn't give you much information about the Two-Year Spinning Flower, and even less about whether or not the flower would emit light.
不论是掌门还是千流岛岛主给你关于两仪旋覆花的消息都不是很多，更是不会涉及到这花是否会发出光芒。=regardless of whether...HeadmasterStill, the Thousand Streams Island Island Master didn't give you much information about the Two-Year Spinning Flower, and even less about whether or not the flower would emit light.
你也没想太多，只是展开神识探查，至于是不是你所求之物，在排除危险之后再去一探究竟便可。=You don't think too much about it, you just expand your divine sense to explore, as to whether it is the thing you seek, after removing the danger, then go to find out the truth can be.
前面是...一具尸骸，尽头确实是一朵花，似乎没有外泄的灵力，花朵的颜色应该是金黄？即便用神识探知也是如此朴实无华，若是长在花丛中一定会被忽视吧。=In front of it was... A corpse, at the end is indeed a flower, there seems to be no outward leakage of spiritual energy, the color of the flower should be golden? Even when probed with divine sense it is so plain and unassuming, if it were to grow amongst the flowers it would surely be overlooked, right?
倒是刚才经过的尸骸有些令人在意，难道花本身就是危险？=Rather, the corpses that had just passed by were somewhat concerning; were the flowers themselves the danger?
一边思考着，你离开洞口，越过尸骸，逐渐靠近两仪旋覆花之所在。=While thinking about this, you leave the cave entrance and cross over the corpses, gradually approaching the place where the Two-Eyed Spinning Flower is located.
活死人=living dead person
“喂，主人在睡觉呢，你就这么大摇大摆地闯进来了？”="Hey, the master is sleeping, and you just waltzed in here?"
你欲走近摘取那两仪旋覆花时，不知从何处传来了声响。=As you were about to approach to pick the two-gee spinning flower, a sound came from nowhere.
似乎是身后？但你身后只有洞口，以及那具残破但还未腐烂的尸体。=It seems to be behind you? But the only thing behind you is the hole, and the mangled but not yet decomposed body.
我在这里呆了上千年，应该能算是我家了吧，嗯对，就是这样。=I've been here for thousands of years, I should be able to consider it my home, well yeah, that's it.
你回过头，发现“尸体”晃悠着站了起来，即便他的躯体结构已经难以让身体直立，即便左脚已经不翼而飞，但不知是否依靠着灵力支撑，它确实又站了起来。=You look back and see the "corpse" wobbling to its feet, and even though its structure makes it difficult for the body to stand upright, and even though its left foot is missing, it does stand up again, whether or not it's relying on psychic energy to support it.
欢迎光临弊舍，可惜这里连个座位都没有，要不我给你泡杯茶？=Welcome to the hostel, it's a pity there's not even a seat here, why don't I make you a cup of tea?
说着，他作势欲往前走动，但因为身躯过于残破而看起来非常别扭。=With that, he made a gesture to move forward, but it looked very awkward because his body was too mangled.
哈哈，抱歉抱歉，这里连杯子都没有，只能怠慢一下了。=Haha, sorry sorry sorry, there's not even a cup here, so I'll just have to slack off a bit.
这“人”看起来说话有些颠三倒四神智不太清晰，似乎很好对付，但也不知是敌是友，所以你没有轻易接话。=This "person" seems to speak a little confused and not very clear, seems to be very easy to deal with, but also do not know whether it is a friend or foe, so you do not easily answer.
躯体残破成这样还能动弹，难道是傀儡？老头你怎么看？=The body is tattered like this and still able to move, is it a puppet? What do you think, old man?
你小声嘀咕着，但是魏无极的声音还是未出现，反倒是“傀儡”的声音再次响起。=You muttered in a low voice, but Wei Wuji's voice still did not appear, instead, the voice of the "puppet" sounded again.
傀儡？当然不是，我可是活生生的人类修...等等，也没那么活生生，这么多年过去身体越来越不好使了呢，不过身体不就是被魂体操控的傀儡么，倒也无妨...如果只剩魂体也能活下去，那人类修士到底算什么呢，嗯...=A puppet? Of course not, I'm a living, breathing human... Wait, I'm not that alive, my body is getting worse and worse after so many years, but my body is just a puppet controlled by my soul, so it doesn't matter... If only the soul body can live, then what exactly is a human cultivator?
啊，不对，这些并不重要。=Ah, no, those don't matter.
重要的应该是这位=The important one should be this one.
，你来这破烂洞穴是想寻找什么呢？说不定我还能帮上些忙，毕竟这洞穴中我可是了如指掌。=So, what are you looking for in this shitty cave? Maybe I can be of some help, after all, I know this cave like the back of my hand.
重要的应该是这位道友，你来这破烂洞穴是想寻找什么呢？说不定我还能帮上些忙，毕竟这洞穴中我可是了如指掌。=The important one should be this one.daoistSo, what are you looking for in this shitty cave? Maybe I can be of some help, after all, I know this cave like the back of my hand.
当然，也没有什么有价值的物事就是，恐怕你要白跑一趟了哈哈哈。=Of course, there's nothing of value that is, so I'm afraid you're going to have to make a trip for nothing hahaha.
哦不对，我怎么忘了，当年那蠢蛇偷袭我之后自己也重伤濒死，估摸着应该也在附近陨落了吧，你要是运气不错还能捡着些=Oh no, how could I forget, that stupid snake attacked me that year, he was seriously injured and dying, I think he should have fallen nearby, if you are lucky you can still pick up some!
的炼器材料，不枉此行。=of refining materials, it was not worth the trip.
哦不对，我怎么忘了，当年那蠢蛇偷袭我之后自己也重伤濒死，估摸着应该也在附近陨落了吧，你要是运气不错还能捡着些五品的炼器材料，不枉此行。=Oh no, how could I forget, that stupid snake attacked me that year, he was seriously injured and dying, I think he should have fallen nearby, if you are lucky you can still pick up some! 5th Classof refining materials, it was not worth the trip.
它的巢穴在...应该是这个方向？去找找看吧。=It's nest is in... Should be this direction? Go look for it.
那“人”好心地用手为你指明了方向，但他显然没有发现自己少了根手指，于是指明方向的动作反而看着让人有些...迷惑且好笑。=The "man" kindly points you in the right direction with his hand, but he apparently doesn't realize he's missing a finger, so the pointing looks a little... Confusing and funny.
（蠢蛇...说的应该是进来时发现的那具骸骨？他似乎还蛮好心的，可惜那具尸骨已经散尽灵气没法用了。不对，他是想把我注意力从两仪旋覆花上转移开么？）=(Stupid Snake...) Is he talking about the skeleton he found when he came in? He seems to be quite kind, but it's a pity that the skeleton has lost its aura and can't be used anymore. No, is he trying to divert my attention away from the Two-Eyed Flower?)
但他不知道的是，你的目标很明确，就是这洞穴中那朵不起眼的小花——两仪旋覆花，所以你并没有离开的打算，而只是淡漠地看着他，提防着可能会出现的偷袭。=But what he doesn't know is that your goal is clear, it's that inconspicuous little flower in this cavern - the Two-Year Spinning Flower, so you have no intention of leaving, but instead just look at him indifferently, wary of any sneak attacks that might come your way.
咦？不感兴趣么...难道说？=Huh? Not interested?... Is that it?
“传说？”="Legend?"
不是啊，咳咳，不提也罢，不提也罢。=No, ahem, don't mention it, don't mention it.
就是我那倒霉体质咯，总是莫名其妙惹到别的势力，要不是自己实力够强，=It's my unlucky body that always somehow messes with other forces, if I wasn't strong enough.
就死了不知道多少回了，难能活到元婴。=It would have died an unknown number of times, and it would have been difficult to live to be a YuanYing.
就是我那倒霉体质咯，总是莫名其妙惹到别的势力，要不是自己实力够强，炼气期就死了不知道多少回了，难能活到元婴。=It's my unlucky body that always somehow messes with other forces, if I wasn't strong enough.Qi refiningIt would have died an unknown number of times, and it would have been difficult to live to be a YuanYing.
你能以这种形态存活也是因为自身实力？=You survived in this form because of your own strength?
这个形态？不...当然是，你还见过别的修士有这能耐么？=This form? No... Of course it is. Have you ever seen another monk with this ability?
那倒没有。=That's not true.
但是见过更奇怪的。=But have seen stranger.
为了不让他继续啰嗦，你只是在心里补上后半句。可他似乎没有停下的意思。=To keep him from continuing to babble, you just mentally add the second half of the sentence. But he doesn't seem to be stopping.
哎，我这种天才是多招天道恨，要多倒霉才会刚入元婴就在这啥都没有的洞窟里莫名其妙地被半步化神的蠢蛇偷袭啊，不过我被困在这里，那家伙也好不了多少级就是哈哈哈。=Hey, my kind of genius is how to attract the heavenly Dao hate, to be more unlucky will just enter the YuanYing in this nothing cave inexplicably by the half-step Transformation of God's stupid snake sneak attack ah, but I'm trapped here, that guy is not much better level is hahaha.
说起来，当年我误入这洞窟也是因为被追杀来着。好像是哪个商会的运输灵舟被人截了，不知怎的就怪在了我头上。=Speaking of which, back then, I mistakenly entered this cave because I was being chased. It seems that the transportation spirit boat of a chamber of commerce was intercepted, and somehow it was blamed on me.
对对对，就是这样，当时我才=Yes, yes, yes, that's it. That's when I was
，还是在被追杀途中找了个空隙躲起来突破的...当时啊，真惊险...=I was chased and found a gap to hide in... It was a thrill...
对对对，就是这样，当时我才金丹后期，还是在被追杀途中找了个空隙躲起来突破的...当时啊，真惊险...=Yes, yes, yes, that's it. That's when I wasLate Golden CoreI was chased and found a gap to hide in... It was a thrill...
他的经历对于寻常修士来说可能非常惊心动魄，但是对你来说有些寻常，要说对他有什么兴趣的话，更可能是储物袋。=His experience may be very thrilling for an unusual cultivator, but it is somewhat unusual for you, and if you want to say that you have any interest in him, it is more likely to be the storage bag.
但他躯体都残破至此，按他自己的说法又是在此停留了上千年，很难说储物袋是否完好。与一个不知是否有价值的怪异个体战斗并不是明智之选。=However, with his torso all mangled to this point, and having been here for thousands of years by his own account, it was hard to tell if the storage bag was intact. It was not wise to fight a strange individual that he didn't know if he was worth anything.
此行的目的还是两仪旋覆花，如果能避免一场战斗也没什么不好的。=The purpose of this trip was still the Two-Year Spinning Flower, and there was nothing wrong if a battle could be avoided.
当然，如果他先动手就不一样了。=Of course, it would be different if he made the first move.
喂，就这样无视我可不好啊。=Hey, it's not good to just ignore me like that.
我对你的故事没有兴...=I'm not interested in your story...
你一边说着一边继续向两仪旋覆花走去，但未等你说完，那“人”似乎是被你触碰到了底线，愤然出手。=You continue to walk towards the Two Elegant Repeating Flowers as you speak, but before you finish speaking, that "person" seems to be touched by you and strikes out angrily.
早已死去的肉身上依附着强大的魂体，这既是他的优势也是他的弱点。每受到两次神识系伤害，则=A powerful soul body attached to long dead flesh is both his strength and weakness. For every two Divine Sense-based injuries taken, the

像是利刃刺穿薄纸一般，你的术法击穿了他的“肉体”，并击散了他的魂体。=Like a sharp blade piercing through thin paper, your spell pierced through his "flesh" and dispersed his soul.
但似乎是受到了两仪旋覆花的影响，这魂体并没有完全消散，而是迅速地再次聚拢在那愈发残破的身体上，还未等你多想什么，又是一记神通朝你袭来。=However, it seems to have been affected by the Two Elemental Spinning Flower, this soul body does not completely dissipate, but quickly gathers again on that more and more tattered body, and before you can think of anything else, another Divine Power strikes at you.
抢夺两仪旋覆花=Grab the Two-Eyed Revolving Flower
魂体竟然无法被击散，是那朵花的原因么？既然如此...=I can't believe the soul body can't be broken apart. Is it because of that flower? In that case...
你闪过他的攻击，运起遁术，身形朝那两仪旋覆花掠去。=You dodged his attack and utilized the Transportation Technique, your body swept towards that Two-Eyed Spinning Flower.
他显然也知道自己为何能保持现在的奇妙状态苟存于世，拖着残破的身体向你冲了过来。但你毕竟一早就占据了更靠内的位置，他已经无法阻止。=He obviously knows why he's surviving in his current marvelous state, and drags his broken body towards you. But you had, after all, taken a more inward position early on, and he had been unable to stop it.
这花看起来似乎也没什么特别的。=The flower doesn't seem to be anything special.
不出意外地，你先他一步抵达两仪旋覆花旁，摘下来之前，你甚至有时间打量了这花一番。=Unsurprisingly, you arrive at the Two-Eyed Whirling Dervish before he does, and you even have time to survey the flower before picking it.
不，我的修仙路不能在此终止！=No, my path to immortality cannot end here!
那“人”嘶吼着继续向你冲来，但似乎是忌惮着什么在不远处又停了下来。=The "man" hisses and continues to charge at you, but seems to be afraid of something and stops a short distance away.
你的修仙路早就终止了不是么？就你现在的状态，别说离开这里，连修炼都做不到吧？=Your path to immortality ended a long time ago, didn't it? In your current state, you can't even cultivate, let alone leave this place, right?
既是没有希望，又何必挣扎呢？=If there is no hope, why struggle?
不会的，不会的！我一定能找到修炼的办法，我一定能走出去...=No, it won't! I'll find a way to cultivate, I'll be able to walk out...
当年若不是被那该死的妖兽伏杀，我也是一代天骄...=Back then, if I wasn't ambushed by that damn demonic beast, I would have been a generation of heavenly pride...
对，对对，要是再给我一点时间，我一定能得道成仙！=Yes, yes, yes, if I had a little more time, I would have achieved immortality!
强行离开=kick off
你没有在意他的话语，趁着他不注意，施展遁术准备迅速离开洞穴。=You pay no attention to his words, and while he's not looking, you cast a recluse spell to prepare for a quick exit from the cave.
“噗通”="Pfft."
在越过他时并没有提防中的攻击，只有一道声响传入你耳中。=There is no attack in caution as you cross him, only a sound that reaches your ears.
虽有些意外，但你还是头也不回地离开了。=It was a bit of a surprise, but you left without looking back.
事件=event

获得两仪旋覆花x1=Acquired Inverted Flower x 1
竹山宗用于蕴养沁云竹的独特药材，据说没有其他用途。=The unique herbs used by the Bamboo Mountain Sect to contain the Qinyun Bamboo are said to have no other use.
前往极阴三海海岛寻找阴冥冻泉。=Travel to the sea island of the Three Seas of Extreme Yin in search of the Frozen Spring of the Underworld.
气温并不低，对于普通凡人来说可能只是在凉爽上再添一点寒意，对于修士来说更是可以忽略的温度。=The temperature wasn't low, it might be just a little chill on top of the coolness for ordinary mortals, and even more negligible temperature for cultivators.
但岩壁上却挂着冰凌，地上铺着薄冰，循着光看去倒也算得上五光十色。=But the rock walls are hung with ice cream, the ground is covered with thin ice, and it is quite colorful when you follow the light.
似乎听见水声了，离冻泉泉眼应该不远了。=Seems to be hearing water. Shouldn't be far from the Frozen Springs spring.
这洞窟竟会在这种温度下结冰，有些意思。=There is something interesting about this cave freezing at these temperatures.
这冻泉只会出现在极阴三海，又得依靠那两仪旋覆花才能带出这片海域，而这花对魂体有奇怪的影响...=This Frozen Spring would only appear in the Three Seas of Extreme Yin, and one would have to rely on that Two-Dimensional Spinning Flower to bring it out of this sea, and the flower had a strange effect on the soul body...
要说有什么联系，可能是阴气。=To say there is a connection, it could be the yin.
嗯，有道理。=Well, that makes sense.
但宗门那沁云竹的营养液为什么需要这两种颇为独特的灵物呢？=But why did the Sect's nutrient solution for that Qinyun Bamboo require these two rather unique spiritual substances?
咳咳，虽然老夫见多识广，但老夫毕竟是剑修，对这种级别培育灵植确是不懂。=Ahem, although the old man has seen a lot of things, but the old man is after all a sword cultivator, and he really doesn't know anything about cultivating spiritual plants at this level.
算了，这也不重要，回去问问=Forget it. It doesn't matter. Go back and ask.
吧。=Right.
算了，这也不重要，回去问问掌门吧。=Forget it. It doesn't matter. Go back and ask.HeadmasterRight.
一边说着，你和魏无极已经到了洞窟的尽头。=While talking, you and Wei Wuji have already reached the end of the cave.
不知不觉中，虽然洞中的温度并没有变化，但脚下的薄冰早已变成厚重的冰层。=Unconsciously, although the temperature in the cave did not change, the thin ice under his feet had long since turned into a thick layer of ice.
似乎没说需要上面的冰块还是下面的泉水...=Doesn't seem to say if you need ice on top or spring water on the bottom...
掌门似乎没说需要上面的冰块还是下面的泉水...=HeadmasterDoesn't seem to say if you need ice on top or spring water on the bottom...
既然是冻泉，那便应是冰块部分吧。=Since it is a frozen spring, it should be the ice part, right?
你点点头表示对魏无极的认同，而后凿下一些冰块与两仪旋覆花一同存入储物袋中。=You nod your head to show your approval of Wei Wuji, and then chisel down some ice to deposit into your storage bag along with the Two Element Spinning Flower.
阴冥冻泉=阴冥冻泉
获得阴冥冻泉x1=Acquired netherworld x 1
竹山宗用于蕴养沁云竹的独特药材，只有用特别的方法才能带出阴冥三海。=The unique herbs used by the Bamboo Mountain Sect to contain the Qinyun Bamboo could only be brought out of the Three Seas of Yin and Underworld by a special method.
回到门派提交阴冥冻泉和两仪旋覆花。=Return to the Sect to submit the Underworld Frozen Spring and the Two-Element Spinning Flower.
获取失败=Failed to get
冷淡=lukewarm
声望：=Reputation:
你放下桌上的玉简，静静等待，一炷香的功夫，云秋兰缓缓醒来。睡眼惺忪，揉了揉眼睛，有些迷糊地看着你。=You put down the jade slip on the table and waited quietly. After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Yun Qiulan slowly woke up. Rubbing her sleepy eyes, she looked at you somewhat dazedly.
澹台姐~我睡了多久了...欸？！是你？=Sister Dantai~ How long have I been sleeping... huh?! It's you?
云秋兰神色一喜，脸上绽开了笑容，随即有些不好意思，急忙端坐起来。=Yun Qiulan's face brightened with joy, and she smiled. Then, feeling a bit embarrassed, she quickly sat up.
让你久等了...澹台姐，怎么不把我喊起来呀~=I made you wait so long... Sister Dantai, why didn't you wake me up?
澹台仙温柔地看着云秋兰，轻轻笑了笑。=Dantai Xian looked at Yun Qiulan gently and smiled softly.
没睡多久，这不是看你好久没睡这么熟了，让你多养养神嘛。=You haven't slept for long. I saw that you were sleeping so soundly for a long time, so I thought you should rest more.
你呀，真是的，我都金丹期啦，还当我是十几岁的小孩子呀，既然人都齐了，我们快快出发吧。=Oh, come on, I'm already at the Golden Core stage, and you still treat me like a teenager. Since everyone is here, let's hurry up and set off.
云秋兰看起来精神了不少，她挥手将桌面上的书简收起，领着你们来到客栈的一隅。=Yun Qiulan looked much more energetic. She waved her hand to tidy up the documents on the table and led you to a corner of the inn.
她有些神秘地挑了挑眉，看起来有些得意，似乎有什么东西要向你们展示。=She raised her eyebrows mysteriously, looking somewhat proud, as if she had something to show you.
秋兰，我们不是要去云府吗？=Qiulan, aren't we supposed to go to the Yun Mansion?
嘿嘿...当然啦~你瞧——=Hehe... of course~ Look—
云秋兰素手在身前轻轻挥舞，口中念念有词，你们脚下居然出现了一个阵法，光芒笼罩之下，再一睁眼，已然到了一个陌生的房屋当中。=Yun Qiulan waved her hand in front of her, chanting softly. Suddenly, a formation appeared under your feet. Bathed in light, when you opened your eyes again, you were already in an unfamiliar house.
云府=The Yun Mansion.
站稳脚跟，眼前云开雾散，只见窗明几净，素雅别致，一尘不染。=Standing firm, the mist cleared before your eyes, revealing a clean and elegant room, spotlessly clean.
往外观瞧，窗外是一处清幽的小院，茂林修竹，碧水环绕。=Looking out, you saw a tranquil courtyard, surrounded by lush greenery and clear water.
山不高而青，水不深而秀，花不多而艳，竹不密而屏，室不宽而雅，外有翠竹隐隐，内有小院泥轩，真是幽深僻静，令人心旷神怡。\r\n=The mountains were not high but green, the water not deep but clear, the flowers not many but colorful, the bamboo not dense but screening. The room was not wide but elegant, with green bamboo faintly visible outside and a small courtyard mud pavilion inside, truly secluded and peaceful, making people feel relaxed and happy.
就是这里啦~=This is it~
回到这里，云秋兰似乎变回了年幼的孩子，有些兴奋。=Returning here, Yun Qiulan seemed to turn back into a young child, feeling excited.
澹台姐，之前仿制的浑天环修好了吗？快拿出来吧！=Sister Dantai, has the replica Hun Tian Ring been repaired? Bring it out quickly!
澹台仙也被云秋兰的情绪所感染，开心地笑笑，从袖中放出一个朴素的宝环。=Dantai Xian was also infected by Yun Qiulan's emotions and smiled happily, taking out a simple treasure ring from her sleeve.
当然了，我你还不放心吗？不过，你会用吗？=Of course, are you still worried? But, can you use it?
嘿嘿，当年我是小，不是傻啦。我看见过父亲和母亲打开过这里的禁制，所以之前才一直缠着你帮我炼那个环。可惜拿到之后发现修为不够，一直拖到现在。=Hehe, I was young back then, not stupid. I saw my father and mother open the restrictions here, so that's why I kept bothering you to help me refine this ring. Unfortunately, I found out after getting it that my cultivation wasn't enough, so I've been putting it off until now.
喏，你瞧~=Here, take a look~
云秋兰将宝环轻轻托起，注入灵力，宝环闪闪发光，高悬半空，将你们包裹其间。=Yun Qiulan gently lifted the treasure ring, infused it with spiritual power, and it shone brightly, hovering in mid-air, enveloping you all.
跟我来吧，屋里有很强的引力禁制，我没有办法解除，但是用宝环能庇护我们进去。=Follow me. There's a strong gravitational restriction inside the house that I can't remove, but we can use the treasure ring to protect us as we enter.
要去哪里啊？=Where are we going?
屋内的门居然倏地开了，里面竟是恒如长老。=The door inside the house suddenly opened, revealing Elder Hengru.
没想到，你居然能查到这么远。=I didn't expect you to investigate so far.
恒如长老...=Elder Hengru...
嘿嘿，我看着你长大，我还不懂你？你一往云汐城跑，我就知道你要来这里。=Hehe, I've watched you grow up. Don't you think I understand you? Every time you head to Yunxi City, I know you're coming here.
唉，也无妨，有些事情是该让你知道了。=Ah, it's fine. Some things you should know.
恒如带着你们向里走去，云秋兰显然没有了刚才的兴奋，一直沉默不语。=Hengru led you inside, but Yun Qiulan seemed to lose her earlier excitement, remaining silent throughout.
就是这里了，书房内和卧室内各有一个禁制，只有你们云家血脉才能打开。=This is it. There are restrictions in both the study and the bedroom, which only those of the Yun family bloodline can open.
走吧，先去开书房里的。=Let's go, let's start with the study.
云秋兰并无多言，神色看不出阴晴悲喜，一边说着，一边随着恒如步入书房，伸手抚上禁制。\r\n=Yun Qiulan remained silent, her expression unreadable, as she followed Hengru into the study and reached out to touch the restriction.
禁制流转着水蓝色和土黄色的光芒，如阴阳鱼一般，欢快地旋转了几圈，便消散了。\r\n=The restriction emitted a swirling light of water blue and earth yellow, like a yin-yang fish, joyfully spinning a few times before dissipating.
恒如伸手，将物件从里面一一捡拾出来。\r\n=Hengru reached out and began picking up items from inside.
呵，清正这小子还算讲情义，以前的这些旧物保存得倒是稳稳当当\r。\n=Haha, Qingzheng was quite sentimental. These old items have been well preserved.
看到这些旧物，恒如好像变了个人似的，竟有些多愁善感起来。=Seeing these old items, Hengru seemed to undergo a transformation, becoming somewhat sentimental.
秋兰，你不是想知道你父母的故事吗，就让我讲给你听吧。\r\n=Qiulan, do you want to know about your parents' story? Let me tell you.
你父亲，清正剑仙，乃是近百年来我宗唯一一个剑修天骄，平素为人正直刚毅，和善仗义，谦虚谨慎。而你母亲，净雅仙子，则是星河剑派的大美人。\r\n=Your father, Qingzheng Sword Immortal, was the only sword cultivator prodigy of our sect in nearly a century. He was upright, strong-willed, kind, and just, as well as humble and cautious. And your mother, Jingya Immortal, was the beauty of the Star River Sword Sect.
这里存放的，看来应该都是他修炼之途上颇为重要之物。\r\n=The items stored here seem to be quite important to his cultivation journey.
一些旧时礼物=Some old gifts.
一对精致玉璧=A pair of delicate jade bi
一份神通玉简=A jade slip of magical powers
一本阵器心得=A book on array techniques
化尘剑法...我记得是你父亲第一本练习的神通。在他之前，化尘教估计都几百年没人正儿八经地练过了。\r\n=The Dust-Transforming Sword Technique... I remember it was the first magic skill your father practiced. Before him, it seems no one in the Dust-Transforming Sect had practiced seriously for centuries.
呵，我们俩个也真是怪胎，尽练一些没人练的东西。他练剑，我练引力，还都让我们练成了...可惜，可惜...\r\n=Haha, we were both oddballs, practicing things no one else did. He practiced swordsmanship, and I practiced gravity, and we both ended up... unfortunately, unfortunately...
云清正...雨净雅...呵...这一对玉璧应是你父母结为道侣的时候，化尘教掌门和星河剑派掌门送的贺礼，以此见证两派的情谊。\r\n=Yun Qingzheng... Yun Jingya... Haha... These jade bi should have been gifts from the heads of the Dust-Transforming Sect and the Star River Sword Sect when your parents became Dao companions, a testament to the friendship between the two sects.
也是少见，咱们一帮玩沙子的，居然能赢取星河剑派美人的芳心。还记得当初清正把清雅仙子引荐给掌门的时候，掌门惊讶得下巴都合不上，还怪好笑的...现在想来真是恍惚非常...\n=It's also rare. A bunch of us playing in the sand, and we managed to win the heart of a beauty from the Star River Sword Sect. I still remember when Qingzheng introduced Qingya Immortal to the sect head, the sect head was so surprised his jaw dropped, it was quite amusing... looking back now, it's all so surreal...
......没想到我们送给他的东西他都还留着。=...I didn't expect him to keep the things we gave him.
恒如抚摩着一把名贵的宝剑，眼里似乎满是失落。=Hengru caressed a valuable sword, his eyes seemingly filled with loss.
当初...他救了我的命，这把剑就是为了感谢他才特地为他炼制的。=Back then... he saved my life, and this sword was specially refined for him as a thank you.
唉...我与他一同入门，一同修炼，一同拜师...虽然理念和行事上有差别，但他从来没有因此而对我有亏待或疏远...可惜，再也回不去了。=Sigh... we entered the sect together, cultivated together, and had the same master... although our ideologies and actions differed, he never mistreated or distanced himself from me because of that... but unfortunately, we can never go back.
你母亲精通阵法，而你父亲又精通炼器之道，二人相辅相成，相爱相守，真是一对神仙眷侣。=Your mother was proficient in array formations, while your father was skilled in refining treasures. They complemented each other, loving and supporting each other, truly an immortal couple.
瞧，这屋内的禁制应该就是你母亲的手笔。当年我们请星河剑派的长老前来一同破解，可这禁制那些阵法大师谁也没有见过。\r\n=Look, the restrictions in this room should be your mother's handiwork. When we invited elders from the Star River Sword Sect to help decipher it together, none of the array masters had seen anything like it.
居然将引力如此完美地运用在阵法之中，这个阵法...大概只有我们秘境中有了，可见你母亲的阵法之道之深厚。=To integrate gravity so perfectly into an array... this array... probably only exists in our realm, showing the depth of your mother's array skills.
以我的引力，只能勉强支撑，但其中关键部位的禁制必须有云家血脉才能打开。没有办法，我们只能罢手，将这里封存保护起来，慢慢地也被人遗忘了。=With my gravity, I can only barely support it, but the crucial parts of the restrictions must be opened by someone of the Yun family bloodline. We have no choice but to leave it here, sealed and protected, gradually forgotten by people.
这里看的差不多了，看来更重要的东西应该放在卧室里，咱们走吧。=We've seen enough here; the more important things should be in the bedroom. Let's go.
...秋兰，我很抱歉...我也很不希望与清正交手，更不愿意相信他会做出那种事。=...Qiulan, I'm sorry... I also didn't want to confront Qingzheng, and I didn't want to believe he would do such a thing.
但...证据确凿，群情激奋，不罚不足以服众...我们能保住的，只有你了。=But... the evidence is conclusive, and the public is incensed. If we don't punish him, it won't appease them... the only one we can save is you.
说着，一行人默默步入卧房。眼前是两个你没见过的身影，云秋兰突然显得十分兴奋。=With that, the group silently entered the bedroom. Before you were two figures you hadn't seen before, and Yun Qiulan suddenly seemed very excited.
爹？娘？=Father? Mother?
云清正：=Yun Qingzheng:
雨净雅：=Yun Jingya:
恒如看了看兴奋的云秋兰，叹了口气。=Hengru looked at the excited Yun Qiulan and sighed.
不过是阵法的影像而已。这里应该是禁制的关键之处了，有神识威能加护，不要被迷惑了。=It's just an illusion of the array. This should be the key point of the restriction, protected by spiritual power. Don't be misled.
云秋兰醒了醒神，挥手将幻影除去，神色哀伤，轻轻抚上卧室的禁制。=Yun Qiulan snapped out of her excitement, waved her hand to dispel the illusion, looked sad, and gently touched the restriction on the bedroom.
禁制开了。里面空空如也。=The restriction opened. It's empty inside.
不应该啊。=This shouldn't be.
难道哪里出错了？=Could something have gone wrong?
什么出错了？=What went wrong?
恒如有些不可置信，反反复复看了好几遍。=Hengru seemed incredulous, repeatedly examining the empty space.
咳咳，按理说这里应该存放着...能够证明你父亲清白的全部档案，可如今...=Ahem, theoretically, there should have been... all the records proving your father's innocence stored here, but now...
...这么说，我父亲他...=...so you mean, my father...
唉...造化弄人。=Sigh... fate is unpredictable.
恒如沉默，眼神低垂，随即抬眼，有些失落地盯着云秋兰。=Hengru fell silent, eyes lowered, then looked up, staring somewhat forlornly at Yun Qiulan.
我知道这很残忍，但...事情已经过去几百年了...真相，在修仙界来说，也许没那么重要...=I know this is cruel, but... it's been hundreds of years since the incident... the truth, in the cultivation world, maybe it's not that important...
如果一直牵挂此事，又如何证得长生？你这样下去，结婴的时候会被心魔折磨的。=If you keep dwelling on this, how will you achieve longevity? You'll be tormented by inner demons when you reach the Jieyin stage.
你已经尽力了，不是吗？而且我们都知道，你父亲是清白的，那就够了，不是吗？何必在乎别人的看法？=You've done your best, haven't you? And we all know your father is innocent, that's enough, isn't it? Why care about what others think?
我、我...=I, I...
云秋兰想说些什么，张口却什么也没有说出来。=Yun Qiulan wanted to say something but couldn't find the words.
秋兰，你告诉我，你觉得我是什么样的人。你说实话，不必顾忌。=Qiulan, tell me, what kind of person do you think I am? Be honest, no need to hold back.
行事上很难称得上是正派，但...对我确实多有照拂...=You're not exactly orthodox in your methods, but... you've taken care of me a lot...
呵，我知道你看不惯我的做法，觉得我的东西不干净，连筑基丹、聚顶丹这类宝物，都不愿意收。=Heh, I know you don't approve of my ways, think my things are dirty, even unwilling to accept treasures like Foundation Pills or Peak-Gathering Pills.
没关系，我就是这么个人，我就是这个活法，我没有你这么高的资质，没有人保护，我只能这样。=It's okay, that's just who I am, that's my way of life, I don't have your high qualifications, no one to protect me, so I can only live like this.
要是事事追根究底，我怕是早就变成一抔黄土了。=If we keep digging into everything, I'm afraid I'd have turned into a clump of dirt long ago.
停手吧，再查下去，对所有人都没好处，尤其是你自己。=Stop it, further investigation won't benefit anyone, especially not you.
你父亲...应该还活着吧，他命大的很，我相信总有一天，他会回来的...我保证，这句话绝对没有骗你。=Your father... should still be alive, he's very lucky, I believe one day he'll come back... I promise you, I'm not lying when I say this.
你好好想一想吧。=Think about it carefully.
说罢，恒如不再多言，转身飘然而去。=With that, Hengru said no more and turned to leave.
澹台仙和云秋兰谁也没有说话。屋内静得出奇，只有浑天环在半空缓缓旋转。=Neither Dantai Xian nor Yun Qiulan spoke. The room was unusually quiet, with only the Heng Ring slowly rotating in mid-air.
秋兰...=Qiulan...
咱们走吧。=Let's go.
云秋兰迈步欲走，却见浑天环光华一闪，轻盈地跃至秋兰手心。云秋兰眼神忽地亮了，似乎是发现了什么。=Yun Qiulan took a step to leave, but suddenly, the Heng Ring flashed with light, lightly jumping into Qiulan's palm. Yun Qiulan's eyes lit up suddenly, as if she had discovered something.
这里！这里还有一个隐藏阵法！=Here! There's another hidden array here!
云秋兰注入灵力，以特殊之法驱使宝环，只见眼前竟出现了一老一少两位修士，实力深不可测。=Yun Qiulan infused it with spiritual power, using a special method to control the artifact. Suddenly, before them appeared two mysterious cultivators, one old and one young, with unfathomable strength.
阴中之阳=Yin in Yang
老夫恭候多时了。=This old man has been waiting for a long time.
阳中之阴=Yang in Yin
嘿嘿，终于出来了，都快闷死了！=Hehe, finally out, was almost suffocating!
别急，我先查探一下有没有人偷听。=Don't worry, let me check if there's anyone eavesdropping first.
二人顿时神情严肃，双眼轻闭。你感到一阵强大而柔和的神识扫过，随即立刻恢复了平静。=The two immediately became serious, closing their eyes lightly. You felt a strong yet gentle divine sense sweep over you, and then everything returned to normal.
老少二人恢复了平和的神色，微笑地看着你们。=The old and the young regained their calm demeanor, smiling at you both.
晚辈云秋兰，不知二位前辈是？=Junior Yun Qiulan, may I know the names of the seniors?
哦？你就是云秋兰？是云清正的后人？=Oh? So you're Yun Qiulan? The descendant of Yun Qingzheng?
竟有如此之事，当真是苍天有眼！=To think such a thing happened, truly a twist of fate!
我们是谁？我们是<color\=#d0380a>清冥活玉</color>啦！=Who are we? We are <color\=#d0380a>Clear Dark Living Jade</color>!
清冥活玉？可是活玉不是...？=Clear Dark Living Jade? But isn't the Living Jade...?
咳咳，此事过于复杂，以你们几个目前的实力，知道太多不是好事，只能等到元婴期之后，才能告诉你们。=Ahem, this matter is too complicated. With your current cultivation level, knowing too much isn't good. You can only be told after reaching the Yuanying stage.
不过可以告诉你的是，万载前的大战，活玉吸收魔气过多，以致正邪离诀，邪玉将正玉封印压制，我们二人则是<color\=#d0380a>正玉</color>的分身，用来逃脱<color\=#d0380a>邪玉</color>的监视。=But what I can tell you is that during the great battle thousands of years ago, the Living Jade absorbed too much demonic energy, causing the separation of Yin and Yang. The Evil Jade sealed and suppressed the Righteous Jade, and we are the incarnations of the <color\=#d0380a>Righteous Jade</color>, used to escape the surveillance of the <color\=#d0380a>Evil Jade</color>.
嗯。如今邪玉为了施展秘法挣脱束缚，受损严重，目前都在闭关静养，我们只能趁着这个时机抓紧恢复，没想到这么快就有机会被召唤而出。=Yeah. Now, the Evil Jade is severely damaged and currently in seclusion to recuperate, as it's trying to break free from its constraints using secret techniques. We can only take advantage of this opportunity to recover quickly. We didn't expect to be summoned so soon.
是啊是啊，被封印起来闷死了，外面发生什么都不知道，只能任由邪玉胡来，真窝囊。=Yes yes, being sealed up was suffocating, not knowing what was happening outside, just letting the Evil Jade do as it pleased, truly miserable.
二人你一言我一语地说着，云秋兰和澹台仙对视一眼，神情有些惊奇。=As the two spoke, exchanging remarks, Yun Qiulan and Dantai Xian exchanged a glance, their expressions somewhat surprised.
...不知道晚辈有什么可以帮助前辈的？=...Is there anything the juniors can help the seniors with?
嘿嘿，你倒是知礼，不过你现在修为太低，等到元婴期才能帮上我们...不过，你的心性不错，有些事情可以先告诉你。=Hehe, you are polite, but your cultivation level is too low right now. Wait until you reach the Yuanying stage to help us... But, your temperament is good, there are some things we can tell you now.
老者说着轻轻一挥手，一个小巧的光球悠悠飘至云秋兰手中。=The old man waved his hand lightly, and a small, delicate light ball floated to Yun Qiulan's hand.
云秋兰下意识地用神识探将过去，顿时朱唇轻启，双瞳微张，昏昏默默，竟一副失神模样。=Yun Qiulan subconsciously probed with her divine sense, and suddenly her lips parted slightly, her pupils dilated, seemingly lost in thought.
前辈，这是？=Senior, what is this?
澹台仙檀眉轻皱，关切地看着秋兰。=Dantai Xian frowned slightly, looking at Qiulan with concern.
老者轻捻胡须，悠然一笑，示意你们不用紧张。=The old man chuckled, gesturing for you both not to be nervous.
她想要知道的事情罢了。=She just wants to know something.
这是...这是......=This is... this is......
云秋兰抬起头来，眼里又有了神采，先前的阴霾、绝望、失落一扫而光，取而代之的是平静与坚定。=Yun Qiulan raised her head, her eyes shining again, the previous gloom, despair, and loss swept away, replaced by calmness and determination.
我明白了前辈，此恩我云秋兰记下了。=I understand, senior, I will remember this favor.
哪有什么恩情，我不过是告诉你你该知道的事情罢了。=What favor? I'm just telling you something you should know.
我相信你会保守好秘密的，为了所有人，为了你自己。=I believe you will keep the secret for the sake of everyone, for yourself.
嘿嘿，要快快突破元婴期哦~=Hehe, make sure to break through to the Yuanying stage soon~
不会太久的。=It won't be too long.
云秋兰洒脱地笑了笑，和澹台师姐传音了什么，澹台师姐神色大变，随即一喜。=Yun Qiulan smiled freely and transmitted something to Dantai Shijie, whose expression changed drastically, then she smiled.
只见云秋兰手指轻轻一点，眼前禁制光华流转，一个崭新的浑天环显露出来，竟是法宝级别！环柄处篆刻着清正剑仙和净雅仙子的名字，看来是二人的作品。=Just as Yun Qiulan gently tapped her finger, the array in front of her shimmered, revealing a brand-new Heng Ring, a treasure-level item! The handle of the ring was engraved with the names of Qingzheng Sword Immortal and Jingya Immortal, indicating it was their work.
这个法宝你拿好哦，这个被这里的禁制藏着，你们自己怕是找不到的。=Take this treasure, it was hidden by the prohibition here, you wouldn't have found it on your own.
好了，时间到了，你这浑天环毕竟不是正品，品阶太低，我们不能在外支撑多久，再久就要被发现了。=Alright, time's up, your Heng Ring isn't the real deal after all, the grade is too low, we can't sustain it outside for too long, or we'll be discovered.
多谢前辈！前辈慢走！=Thank you, seniors! Farewell, seniors!
多谢前辈指点！=Thank you for your guidance, seniors!
眼前的二人悠悠地消失了，云秋兰抚摸着父母留下的法宝，望向远方出神。=The two figures in front of you disappeared leisurely, Yun Qiulan stroked the treasure left by her parents, gazing into the distance in a trance.
你们不知道她在想什么，但是谁也没有打扰她，半晌不语。=You didn't know what she was thinking, but nobody interrupted her, remaining silent for a while.
云秋兰突然回过神来，转头看向了你，向你微微一笑。=Yun Qiulan suddenly came back to her senses, turned her head towards you, and smiled faintly.
此次..多谢。我想在这里独处一会儿，暂且别过，还请见谅...=This time... thank you. I want to be alone here for a while. Farewell for now, please forgive me...
至于到底是怎么回事，待时机成熟，如果你还感兴趣的话，会告诉你的。=As for what exactly happened, when the time is right, if you're still interested, I'll tell you.
云秋兰运转灵力，你只见脚底阵法一闪，眼前的一切便消失了。=Yun Qiulan activated her spiritual power, and you saw a flash of array beneath your feet, and then everything disappeared.Lü
